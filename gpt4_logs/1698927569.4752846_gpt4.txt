1:38:0.20 Nudrat A Demand, which is coming from the fmcl or other that is being produced, but do we also procure for them? 1:38:2.70 --> 1:38:3.430 Nudrat A I'm in procurement. 1:38:9.910 --> 1:38:10.70 Nudrat A No. 1:38:24.810 --> 1:38:25.490 Nudrat A OK. Yeah. 1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:29.880 Nudrat A Yeah, sure, sure. 1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:32.600 Nudrat A Yeah, yeah. Sure. Please, please. 1:38:25.570 --> 1:38:36.10 Kolachalam, Madhu The all the conversation that has been I have like 15 pages of notes. I I think let's convert that into a document and validate that back then trying to redo it. Is that OK nandrit. 1:38:36.490 --> 1:38:37.530 Nudrat A Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. 1:38:38.110 --> 1:38:39.430 Kolachalam, Madhu Thank you. Good listen. 1:38:38.150 --> 1:39:10.550 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. The happy overseas getting to have some more specific discussions around sort of that sort of relationship 'cause. Obviously we don't just say, oh, we need to buy liquid bowl, extract off you go either because obviously it has you know, specification, et cetera. It's likely as Fernando sort of explained earlier, we would find the key materials and ingredients, we would find the supplier ensure that it meets all our specifications, quality specifications that do the audits on the. 1:39:11.230 --> 1:39:17.390 Barrington, Kyle The factory, for example, and the ethical audits that need to be done and then almost. 1:39:17.430 --> 1:39:23.270 Barrington, Kyle Elixir would be calling off against sort of that. That supply that we find. 1:39:24.810 --> 1:39:38.930 Barrington, Kyle And we'd again be involved in some of the price discussions, but, but effectively at the end of that we'd be supporting, but effectively elixir would end up buying it directly from that supplier with their own cash. And then once they've produced into a finished good, selling it to us. 1:39:41.380 --> 1:39:42.100 Barrington, Kyle Thank you, that's all. 1:39:40.170 --> 1:39:42.610 Nudrat A OK, got it. Thank you. 1:39:41.160 --> 1:39:43.880 Kolachalam, Madhu Thanks, dad. And and and and. 1:39:43.380 --> 1:39:46.420 Thiagarajah, Thisan I don't know if this is relevant, I just want to put one point Madhu. 1:39:45.890 --> 1:39:47.530 Kolachalam, Madhu Good, yes. 1:39:48.260 --> 1:39:50.780 Thiagarajah, Thisan Is when they do export, is actually the same product. 1:40:11.150 --> 1:40:11.670 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 1:39:52.140 --> 1:40:11.820 Thiagarajah, Thisan But the difference is that they capture within our SAP systems as a different skew line and actually from a physical change, I think Henry, you mentioned they just stick a sticker. So you know when they get their order for the export, they will stick a sticker to say this is an export stock. But the actual that would be the only difference from a physical limit of of of the of the SKU itself if that makes sense. 1:40:11.390 --> 1:40:12.790 Vinha, Fernando Amazing, yeah. 1:40:12.420 --> 1:40:14.620 Ohikhuai, Henry Yeah, yeah, you are correct. 1:40:14.300 --> 1:40:32.580 Kolachalam, Madhu Now and and where are where are all the product specifications are are we going to have a product spec or product team or an NPD team? Maybe not NPD team, but is there a? Is that a in House team or is that training's team who is going to manage the product specifications? 1:40:39.180 --> 1:40:39.700 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 1:40:35.390 --> 1:40:50.430 Vinha, Fernando We manage their product specification for sure. OK. Nothing's changed it. We have full control in terms of productive specification process. Everything is redefined. OK. 1:40:51.770 --> 1:40:53.290 Vinha, Fernando Is defined by us. 1:40:51.190 --> 1:41:0.830 Kolachalam, Madhu Go and and Fernando, Karen. And how do you do you manage that in a Word document PDF. Where are your recipes or specifications managed currently? 1:41:5.130 --> 1:41:5.610 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 1:41:1.570 --> 1:41:6.890 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. So we we have our quality control that you wanna manage everything OK? 1:41:7.760 --> 1:41:8.360 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 1:41:8.350 --> 1:41:20.550 Vinha, Fernando Fmcl cannot do any change in any spec without our authorization or it because it will be controlled by us as today you have been doing it already. OK, we control everything. 1:41:21.770 --> 1:41:22.770 Kolachalam, Madhu Got. 1:41:21.900 --> 1:41:23.980 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Just, just just. 1:41:22.510 --> 1:41:24.30 Thiagarajah, Thisan To Mother's question though. 1:41:23.710 --> 1:41:25.910 Barrington, Kyle Well, hold on, I think sorry. 1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:28.680 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Just to add to that, Fernando. 1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:54.720 Osusuluwa, Ejiro To the point Madam mentioned regarding recipe and all of that, we currently have a quality team, but that's it's in eligia. While I understand the point around the fact that there cannot be any change to any, whatever has been produced to our specification, but looking at full localization in terms of recipe and all of that mix and all of
