just try and find something that can simplify a little bit things which are complex by nature, but maybe standardize them a little bit more and to to try and find any balance between the time we spend on them and also the the delivery that we can that we can provide to the to the business basically. 0:10:3.10 --> 0:10:4.340 Ricciardi Luca I mean, that's really high level. 0:10:6.120 --> 0:10:6.680 Pankaj Gadekar But when you. 0:10:4.350 --> 0:10:7.550 Ricciardi Luca So yeah, but I'm open in case there is any any question. 0:10:8.700 --> 0:10:12.690 Pankaj Gadekar When you say, uh, So what to produce and uh, what to sell? 0:10:12.700 --> 0:10:15.660 Pankaj Gadekar That's OK, but when you say what to store in warehouse. 0:10:17.810 --> 0:10:25.0 Pankaj Gadekar Apart from, you know, the logistical routes, I mean, you know sales point close to the warehouse and etcetera. 0:10:25.250 --> 0:10:32.30 Pankaj Gadekar Are there any other implications in terms of a shelf life and etcetera that impacts your decision as to what to store? 0:10:32.640 --> 0:10:33.730 Ricciardi Luca Yeah, of course there are. 0:10:33.780 --> 0:10:41.810 Ricciardi Luca In the sense that, I mean we can assume that we work with the shelf life which is standard shelf life for our products, which is in the range of a couple of years. 0:10:41.820 --> 0:10:44.730 Ricciardi Luca But it's extremely dependent dependent on the product. 0:10:44.800 --> 0:11:3.380 Ricciardi Luca So and and and on top of it, what we really need to consider is that in our environment, the disposal of goods, chemical goods, so we just need to remember we are working in a chemical company, which means that this posting of goods is extremely and expensive and it's not something that we want to go for. 0:11:3.390 --> 0:11:17.570 Ricciardi Luca So having issues in scrapping boots which are caused by the fact that we are overstocked in certain warehouses or it's really not not a go to you know something we don't want to go for unless of any specific case. 0:11:30.700 --> 0:11:30.860 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:11:17.580 --> 0:11:34.890 Ricciardi Luca So and yes, we have limitations with the shelf life, but usually delete them that we have is, is and it should not be too much of an issue when when we discuss about the I mean for sure we don't want to store more than two years of of stock just to be clear. 0:11:37.480 --> 0:11:39.250 Pankaj Gadekar And how is the current uh, process? 0:11:39.320 --> 0:11:44.850 Pankaj Gadekar Uh, if you can just give an elaboration what drives the demand so where it starts? 0:11:46.520 --> 0:11:46.790 Ricciardi Luca Yeah. 0:11:45.300 --> 0:11:47.780 Pankaj Gadekar Uh, we can just move this to me. 0:11:46.800 --> 0:11:50.630 Ricciardi Luca So the the input is coming of course from the sales team. 0:11:50.640 --> 0:11:55.910 Ricciardi Luca Plus, you know, information we can gather from the market team, of course here in column feel free to jump in. 0:11:55.920 --> 0:12:7.970 Ricciardi Luca But we are gathering the information from the market through our sales forecast, which is let's say, at the moment we are working with an environment which is not under percent integrated. 0:12:7.980 --> 0:12:8.670 Ricciardi Luca Let's bring this way. 0:12:9.880 --> 0:12:10.550 Pankaj Gadekar That's fine. 0:12:8.680 --> 0:12:11.360 Ricciardi Luca So we have different tools, OK. 0:12:12.10 --> 0:12:12.170 Dempsey Tim Yeah. 0:12:10.560 --> 0:12:12.800 Pankaj Gadekar So, so sorry to interrupt. 0:12:22.850 --> 0:12:23.30 Ricciardi Luca Yep. 0:12:12.810 --> 0:12:30.870 Pankaj Gadekar Irrespective of whether it is integrated, automated and etcetera, uh, that could just be system, but I'm just trying to understand from a process perspective if we can when you say you get input from a sales, so is it from sales people on the field? 0:12:30.880 --> 0:12:31.770 Pankaj Gadekar What are the? 0:12:32.100 --> 0:12:35.320 Pankaj Gadekar I mean, what is the basis on which they give a demand? 0:12:36.180 --> 0:12:36.790 Ricciardi Luca Yes. OK. 0:12:36.800 --> 0:12:37.90 Ricciardi Luca No. 0:12:37.100 --> 0:12:37.600 Ricciardi Luca So we have. 0:12:36.610 --> 0:12:38.20 Dempsey Tim Look like could you want me to? 0:12:38.970 --> 0:12:42.780 Dempsey Tim I can elaborate a little bit or you you feel free to continue. 0:12:43.130 --> 0:12:47.480 Dempsey Tim I just had a few points to add that the forecast is split. 0:12:47.490 --> 0:12:57.880 Dempsey Tim We're we're basing the solver environment where a lot of Excel files are being mashed together every night, and each sales manager has access to their own file. 0:12:58.140 --> 0:13:4.940 Dempsey Tim It's all excel based and the current forecasting process is non statistical. 0:13:4.950 --> 0:13:13.890 Dempsey Tim So we are driven by some statistical figures, but the forecast does not refresh itself on a statistical basis. 0:13:13.960 --> 0:13:21.270 Dempsey Tim It is reliant on manual update by the individual sales managers and also in


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around finding ways to simplify and standardize complex processes, particularly in relation to managing warehouse stock in a chemical company. Factors such as product shelf life and the high cost of disposing chemical goods are considered. The current process involves gathering information from the sales and market teams, using sales forecasts and other tools. However, the system is not fully integrated and relies heavily on manual updates by individual sales managers. The goal is to balance the time spent on these processes and the delivery provided to the business.
