Write a concise summary of the following:


0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:31.160 Kolachalam, Madhu And we started working and we'll continue to do that. This one has mobilised that on the application space is where me and Tyson were discussing several things. I just want to understand a little bit more on your perspective on any, any key concern area specifically to you or or I can just go through and start asking some questions in terms of the big picture. So what I'm trying to do is not not just about Jan 2025 readiness of what I'm trying to look at is like what would a three-year road map look like from an app or a digital strategy for Nigeria? 0:0:32.0 --> 0:0:33.160 Kolachalam, Madhu Or even a four years and then. 0:0:34.520 --> 0:0:56.520 Kolachalam, Madhu Work towards that and then say OK year one is this year 2 is this and we resource it and and also drive that is that that was what I was pushing these on for look. But Jan is important. Let's also think what happens post Jan and all so that was the context in which I wanted to spend some time and work with you. So does that make sense or do you have a different approach or any thoughts? 0:1:0.100 --> 0:1:0.500 Vinha, Fernando It's OK. 0:1:0.490 --> 0:1:11.290 Barrington, Kyle Just some my comment, I think I think a a road map is useful. However, my view is that the priority is on Jan Go live. 0:1:12.770 --> 0:1:30.450 Barrington, Kyle I think if we can't produce in Jan and the systems can't tell us what's happening and we can't track inventory and stuff, we're spending £27 million for for, I suppose nothing. So A3 year mode map is is great. I see that as a. 0:1:32.690 --> 0:1:42.770 Barrington, Kyle An add on rather than the the main focus personally, but it's not my not my call that would only be sort of my my viewpoint. 0:1:44.350 --> 0:1:47.70 Kolachalam, Madhu That's fair game. Now what about others? 0:1:46.210 --> 0:1:56.90 Glyn-Jones, Hugh Yeah, maybe if I can just add in there as as well. Margie. Sorry, I'm Hugh. We haven't met. And I also hadn't met Nuder yet and and Prem and Jerem, so hi everyone. 0:1:57.610 --> 0:2:9.170 Glyn-Jones, Hugh Just to agree with what Kyle has said, I mean this has to obviously fit into the overall biz tech aspect of the of the project and I think. 0:2:10.730 --> 0:2:18.650 Glyn-Jones, Hugh While I agree that the focus is on the production date, we don't want to be developing and putting something in with that as the end date. 0:2:19.250 --> 0:2:48.130 Glyn-Jones, Hugh When we need a bigger picture of what's going to happen further down the lines as we build now, we are taking that into account. So yes, very much our focus is we have to produce on that date, but let's use the time and building and developing wisely now so that we don't find ourselves halfway through 25 May be making changes because we didn't anticipate something. So just the bigger picture as well then but otherwise certainly agree with Kyle's sense of focus there. That's the critical Mario. 0:2:49.260 --> 0:2:49.740 Kolachalam, Madhu Sorry. 0:2:49.20 --> 0:3:3.980 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, it's probably just worth timelines as well. And Fernando, call you in on this, Jan 25 is when we want to produce in terms of go live and that might be Feb 25, but around that, let's just say Jan 25 for the sake of argument. 0:3:4.710 --> 0:3:5.310 Vinha, Fernando OK. 0:3:5.500 --> 0:3:18.180 Barrington, Kyle We'll actually be one to be doing production early in that in terms of testing and running and stuff like that. The Jan 25 is almost when we're going to be producing to sell products to the market. So obviously I'll, I'll. 0:3:35.90 --> 0:3:35.370 Glyn-Jones, Hugh Yeah. 0:3:19.140 --> 0:3:36.780 Barrington, Kyle Rely on is experience in terms of when you'd want that then to be meaning we have a the systems and applications all set up ready to be able to to work and sort of test it. But I but obviously you know it's less time than that is my point which is why I I always feel a bit better about it. 0:3:44.950 --> 0:3:45.750 Vinha, Fernando Yes. 0:3:38.890 --> 0:3:45.770 Kolachalam, Madhu And and tell when you say less time show. Is it fair to say we should be ready by October or November or is it even earlier than? 0:3:47.10 --> 0:3:48.10 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, fernande. 0:3:47.120 --> 0:4:15.800 Vinha, Fernando Yeah, look. Yeah, just adding up what Skyland Hill said. Yes. Yes. You want to produce on Jan, so you need to have the Earp system on working around October 24th. Set up in the system. Test already test. So you need minimal children. The production plan in this season, material plan. It's the minimum you need to run this factory. OK. 0:4:16.770 --> 0:4:17.330 Kolachalam, Madhu Got. 0:4:16.300 --> 0:4:28.940 Vinha, Fernando And so I believe you have the the time from now I'll say from November to October in the coming year to set up what you need in the in the. 0:4:28.980 --> 0:4:31.60 Vinha, Fernando ERP system. 0:4:31.100 --> 0:4:39.340 Vinha, Fernando I think from next year I'm gonna be in Nigeria. So mm


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Madhu Kolachalam initiated a discussion about creating a three to four-year roadmap for an app or digital strategy for Nigeria, beyond the January 2025 readiness. Kyle Barrington emphasized the priority of the January go-live date, considering the significant investment involved. Hugh Glyn-Jones agreed with Kyle's focus on the production date but also stressed the importance of considering the bigger picture during development to avoid future changes. Fernando Vinha confirmed that the ERP system should be working and tested by October 2024 to ensure production by January 2025.
