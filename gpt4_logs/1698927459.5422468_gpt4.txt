quantity attached to it. Based on that, we execute the production. Now when we execute the production normally, we should physically move that goose to Twinings. 1:20:35.60 --> 1:20:35.460 Kolachalam, Madhu Sorry. 1:20:20.890 --> 1:20:51.90 Ohikhuai, Henry You an invoice to twiners on behalf of Twinings. We physically issue the goods to fmcl on behalf of Twinings, an issue an invoice to Twinings. So we do a manual sign off between Fmcl and Alicia. We sign a register, we give them some documents to show that we have transferred these goods physically. However, we send an invoice and it will be to Twinings. So twinings. 1:20:51.670 --> 1:20:56.710 Ohikhuai, Henry Will now take that invoice and will be an issue. An invoice to fmcl. 1:20:59.330 --> 1:20:59.930 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 1:20:59.80 --> 1:21:15.40 Ohikhuai, Henry Showing that this Po that was issue in day one of this month we have executed the production, it can come into different batches. We have executed the production. This is the quantity pay us for it. 1:21:16.950 --> 1:21:17.990 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it, got it. 1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:24.780 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So mother doesn't have the control documents in this situations are is 1. The PU that is raised by. 1:21:27.220 --> 1:21:44.340 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Fmcl then two they system would be that is generated from Oracle that same copy of Weibi system we be is get it copies with elixir with fmcl and with training. 1:21:45.940 --> 1:22:11.820 Kolachalam, Madhu But and and then how does fmcl raise a sales order on Twinings? Do they do that in Oracle and send send a for them? It is? I'm just thinking, yeah, no, that's a purchase order. They're actually raising a purchase order fmcl as an entity is our customer. There is a purchase order in Oracle and that becomes a sales order in Sapp one. So how do they do that? 1:22:13.800 --> 1:22:43.0 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So I don't have feasibility of how fmcl does that in their system. But yes, looking at how the process work, they read the purchase order that is raising their system in which the invoice that we sent to them is mapped to is received into and that's what they use in terms of receiving at their at their own in terms of the purchase of the goods that. 1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:46.40 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Whale will sell to them on a monthly basis. 1:22:47.480 --> 1:23:17.240 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. Alright. OK. I think I think I my only thing is whether we want to integrate not is also dependent on how much of changes happen once we make any decisions in the process. What is the volume of transactions? What is the complexity of data and is there an accuracy impact of doing all this manually as we move forward or as the volumes increase? I think that is my key aspect and is there a simple way to integrate and if you want. 1:23:17.910 --> 1:23:19.950 Kolachalam, Madhu Is there a big pain point? 1:23:21.250 --> 1:23:34.130 Kolachalam, Madhu Henry's row in terms of currently in this end to end process is that which which one takes the maximum manual effort which we could potentially integrate across the systems of B1 and then go at thisan. 1:23:47.20 --> 1:23:47.380 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. 1:23:54.420 --> 1:23:54.940 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 1:23:36.540 --> 1:23:59.980 Thiagarajah, Thisan Looking at a solution that Ashish built for Australia, so you know they're taking all these invoices going to a SharePoint and it uses OCR technology to recognise it and then use RPA to load it in Madhu. So we're not thinking integration directly with SAP B1, but we're looking at that solution if that can be fit for purpose for this particular part. So technically, if you're going forward, all of that transaction could be handled for an automated process taking that burden away from endurance team. 1:24:0.770 --> 1:24:3.170 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it, got it. 1:24:3.210 --> 1:24:5.490 Kolachalam, Madhu Nidrath, do you have your hand up? Sorry, I didn't see that. 1:24:6.300 --> 1:24:16.60 Nudrat A I'm having several questions with respect to this entities, so if you'll allow me, I'll share my screen and I'll I'll just put some of my understanding and I'll I'll put up my questions. 1:24:16.630 --> 1:24:17.710 Kolachalam, Madhu Sure, sure. Go ahead then. 1:24:21.100 --> 1:24:42.820 Thiagarajah, Thisan And it's doing that. There's one point that I think where it's clear madhh when you're asking about export, I don't think they close the points. I didn't capture it when one who did, they actually shoot it to, because if they're not issuing it to fmcl, they're issuing it to the customer that's paid for it. But how does that work? Because do we only issue it to them after we've sent them the product? So we have to include freight costs and all of those things. 1:24:44.20 --> 1:24:46.260 Thiagarajah, Thisan Or do they? Do they come and pick it up from us? 1:24:44.380 --> 1:24:51.260 Kolachalam, Madhu And and it does Fmcl manage that distribution? Or is it another vendor that who manages


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the process of executing production and issuing invoices between different entities. Goods are physically transferred from one entity to another, with invoices issued to Twinings. Twinings then issues an invoice to FMCL. The process involves manual sign-offs and the use of Oracle and SAP systems. There is a consideration of whether to integrate the systems to reduce manual effort and increase accuracy, especially as transaction volumes increase. A solution involving OCR technology and RPA for automation is being considered. Questions were raised about the handling of export and distribution processes.
