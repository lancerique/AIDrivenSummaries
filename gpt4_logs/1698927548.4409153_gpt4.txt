RESPONSE:

Joshua Savidge and Dempsey Tim discuss a large change management program. They emphasize the importance of understanding each other clearly from the beginning to avoid misunderstandings and wasting resources. They agree to take a step-by-step approach, starting with mapping out the current situation before looking at future processes and implementations. They also discuss the need for open communication, with no question being considered stupid. They plan to work towards a workshop, with Tim asking for indicative costs within the next few days. They consider the cost of licenses and discuss the possibility of needing between 10 to 20. They also discuss the need for a deep dive discovery phase.
