CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team discussed their plan to provide datasets in the correct format for the system, with the heavy lifting of data handling being done by them, not the consultants. They also discussed the need to consult their IT team and legal team regarding data access and confidentiality. The team is preparing a business case to present to senior leadership, outlining the business challenge, improvement, cost, and return on investment. They also discussed their IT infrastructure, which is primarily Microsoft-based, and mentioned a tool called Click for driving sales data. The proposed solution would be a cloud-based system.
