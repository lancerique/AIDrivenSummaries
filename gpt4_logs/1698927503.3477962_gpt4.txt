CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around a cloud-based solution that is similar to IBP and can connect and feed data directly into a recipe. The solution is not a one-size-fits-all and will require certain customizations, particularly in the integration part. It can be hosted on-premises for customers concerned about security. The integration can be done in various ways, including automated data pipelines, APIs, SFTP, or integration platforms like SNAP Logic or Microsoft. The solution is flexible and the details can be worked out once the project begins. The team also plans to conduct a discovery phase to understand the current ecosystem and determine the best fitting solution. The data in the cloud-based environment will be owned by the customer, not the service provider. Legal questions regarding intellectual property and confidentiality are yet to be answered. A secondary session with legal teams is suggested to clarify these points.
