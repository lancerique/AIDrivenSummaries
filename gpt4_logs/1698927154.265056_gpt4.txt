Barrington, Kyle Nigeria P&L has every element in the future sort of almost be split into three business units if you will. So one would be the Nigeria commercial performance, one would be the Nigeria factory and then the rest and the other would be the Africa developing markets or or Africa export markets and Nigeria factory to Fernando's point, running on a standard cost basis will sell the product. 0:27:6.240 --> 0:27:35.200 Barrington, Kyle To Nigeria, obviously on a, you know, almost a journal as opposed to real or sale, but they will sell it to Nigeria commercial at the standard price and they will sell it to Africa, export again at the standard price bit like T supply chain do to sort of the intercompany markets. Now I noticed paging is slightly different because they have to actually physically ship the products. So there are actual sales and stuff, whereas this will all be part of the same legal entity, but it would almost be like. 0:27:36.240 --> 0:27:37.520 Barrington, Kyle Andover selling to UK. 0:27:38.600 --> 0:27:40.320 Barrington, Kyle If you will like. 0:27:38.900 --> 0:27:41.140 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. And and and and Kyle Fernando. 0:27:41.150 --> 0:28:11.870 Vinha, Fernando OK. Just a just to be sure I understood what you said, OK, today inhale it as I I couldn't understand you are already work on the standard price because the standard price you do you have a standard price agree for a a quarterly base after quarterly basis, you just make a two up, OK to see the real cost versus that then the standard cost then they standard price so are so you go back and see? 0:28:11.910 --> 0:28:14.390 Vinha, Fernando What happened? And if you want to get the details or not? 0:28:14.870 --> 0:28:53.510 Vinha, Fernando This is not the price you you agreed today is based on the material cost. That is just the bulk you import today plus the package plus vitori conversion cost. So have total cost. So at least you wanna price it to us. OK. And so your price later price it to to FM sell in the future. What change does change that to going to you're going to end up all this this raw material you take out the bulk and put all material plus the conversion cost to become this material in bulk and so back back in Italy that's that's the same as you have today. 0:29:12.310 --> 0:29:12.470 Barrington, Kyle OK. 0:28:53.880 --> 0:29:26.40 Vinha, Fernando So I think it's not a change in the future, you just as I said, wanna agree on this bill of March here, they stand their cost. They say they always stand their cost and so you can continue make a true up every four, every every quarter as you have been doing today nothing changed. But as Kyle said the the way you're going to set up in your system has to be very friendly for me to see the variance. OK. I can. I don't need to wait a quarter base to see this variance. I have to see this variance. 0:29:26.280 --> 0:29:58.520 Vinha, Fernando It just after I close the mouth, I close the mouth. Today I see maximum 10 days late. I have to to see the actor 'cause. I have to see my variance and so I can take action. I I cannot wait for four months to take action. It is more what guy said. I think it's makes sense if I don't have a descent system, I cannot do that. OK, so you need to see how we want to set up it in the Oracle or whatever erpc system you want to use in the future. I don't know how this looks like. I never saw the system. 0:29:59.680 --> 0:30:3.560 Vinha, Fernando Fmsl has been used. How is the screen? How we put datas? 0:30:4.160 --> 0:30:16.40 Vinha, Fernando But I I guess is the same as other system because it cannot change. OK, I think I'll see some. I know it's almost the same, just the way we put the doctors is different, OK? 0:30:17.500 --> 0:30:18.100 Vinha, Fernando It's clear. 0:30:16.380 --> 0:30:48.740 Kolachalam, Madhu So and and Fernando, I have one question. I know nadrat you have your hand up. Give Me 2 minutes and we'll come back to you. So. So, so, Fernando, the other question I have is look, first of all what you are asking is a standard way any ERP works, right? For example, in an Oracle you define your bill of materials stand and not just standard cost. You can break your standard cost into material cost or it cost freight cost, other warheads manufacturing into labour manufacturing overhead in terms of electricity facilities cost you could do it could do. 0:30:48.780 --> 0:30:49.780 Kolachalam, Madhu Whatever modelling we do. 0:30:56.180 --> 0:30:56.380 Vinha, Fernando That. 0:30:59.890 --> 0:31:0.530 Vinha, Fernando Yes. 0:31:17.40 --> 0:31:17.240 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Uh huh. 0:30:50.420 --> 0:31:26.500 Kolachalam, Madhu And then you can connect that back to the specific accounts in the general Ledger and then connect that back to actuals and then generate variance and generate a reporting. You know generating the reporting is where brought the there. But my question is for this process to work, there are certain process and systems they


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Kyle Barrington discussed the future division of Nigeria P&L into three business units: Nigeria commercial performance, Nigeria factory, and Africa developing markets/Africa export markets. The Nigeria factory will sell products at a standard cost to Nigeria commercial and Africa export. Fernando Vinha clarified that the standard price is agreed upon quarterly and then compared to the real cost. He emphasized the need for a system that allows for quick visibility of variances, rather than waiting for a quarterly review. Madhu Kolachalam confirmed that this is a standard process in any ERP system, like Oracle, which can break down standard costs into various components and generate variance reports.
