justify. So you could change and everyone has to sign it. Maybe the financial team has to sign and approve it. 1:2:24.30 --> 1:2:24.790 Vinha, Fernando OK. 1:2:37.750 --> 1:2:39.550 Vinha, Fernando Yes, yes. 1:2:24.650 --> 1:2:55.770 Kolachalam, Madhu So Fernando, typically a below material change is always driven through engineering change note or like a production specification change and that has to be approved by materials finance and all before that gets into that. I think that is a standard Oracle process as well on that actually one of the things I was asking is from a system standpoint, you could configure it to be very complex or very simple. But I think how the inventory gets managed physically, is it a pull push system. 1:2:56.370 --> 1:3:6.650 Kolachalam, Madhu Between manufacturing within the manufacturing floor, from raw materials to manufacturing, from suppliers to raw materials, I think that mapping of the physical process and how that has to manifest in Oracle. 1:3:7.410 --> 1:3:17.50 Kolachalam, Madhu Without complicating it, I think that would be a separate process stream which will and what is the objective of what level of tracking we want would be a separate track. 1:3:17.920 --> 1:3:50.920 Kolachalam, Madhu At least that's what I'm taking away from this. So I think I think I understand the question around manufacturing and the inventory management. My, my other question is on now we have three systems basically, right? I'm I'm calling 3 systems, but there are two systems there is there is Oracle elixir, there is Oracle Fmcl and then there is sapb 1. Twinings, what is the level of integrations we need and not theoretically we could all do that manually, but the challenge is not just efficiency or putting 10 people. 1:3:51.680 --> 1:3:55.760 Kolachalam, Madhu The accuracy suffers in transactions, data entry and things like that. 1:3:57.40 --> 1:4:6.560 Kolachalam, Madhu Are there opportunities that that all of you see and a look at least if these two, three things we can integrate if not total perfect, where which would those be? 1:4:12.820 --> 1:4:22.420 Vinha, Fernando I think they have just one system Oracle with different location inside of Oracle's. Because Alexa is the same as Fmcn, right Kyle? 1:4:23.990 --> 1:4:32.190 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think the question was, did the integration between SAP B1 and Oracle as in my view, there doesn't have to be. 1:4:32.80 --> 1:4:33.200 Vinha, Fernando OK, I yeah. 1:4:33.160 --> 1:4:34.760 Barrington, Kyle It doesn't have to be any. 1:4:36.990 --> 1:4:42.110 Barrington, Kyle Initially and maybe never, I think in SAP B1. 1:4:43.550 --> 1:4:47.470 Barrington, Kyle Like we can simply record purchase from. 1:4:50.390 --> 1:4:58.350 Barrington, Kyle Alexa, sorry I was get my notes mixed up my head so we can simply record OK, we purchased product from Alexa at at this. 1:4:59.990 --> 1:5:6.550 Barrington, Kyle What we would probably want to do, and I would this can be discussed by, says in my view, I think. 1:5:17.490 --> 1:5:17.770 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. 1:5:7.420 --> 1:5:21.140 Barrington, Kyle Obviously, we're going to have, I think what we might want to do in SAP one is almost record because as I said, we're almost going to have like a supply sort of call it business unit, it's got its own PL. So you'd have sales at. 1:5:23.850 --> 1:5:31.970 Barrington, Kyle X volumes times price, you know that's that'll be a sales number then obviously our costs then are basically recharges from. 1:5:33.410 --> 1:5:42.370 Barrington, Kyle Final finished product from Alexa plus any costs that we incur directly. So for example, one might be because we own the factory site. 1:5:43.970 --> 1:5:52.450 Barrington, Kyle Gas, we might think it's for us to engage directly with the the gas supplier and just pay that directly because otherwise elixir are going to do that. 1:5:57.510 --> 1:5:57.750 Vinha, Fernando Good. 1:5:53.250 --> 1:6:8.90 Barrington, Kyle And then we will pay a pre, you know, a mark up on it, but maybe that might be an example where we engage directly both. So there might be some costs incurred directly as well that would go into SAP B1. 1:6:8.110 --> 1:6:10.70 Barrington, Kyle I think what would then be good is. 1:6:11.430 --> 1:6:13.550 Barrington, Kyle If you can then break down. 1:6:16.60 --> 1:6:17.380 Barrington, Kyle Key headings. 1:6:18.780 --> 1:6:24.780 Barrington, Kyle Of but again, I think manually input potentially to begin with of what those you know, the costs are. 1:6:26.500 --> 1:6:41.260 Barrington, Kyle Which we can get from Alexia, I think that would work. And then if there's data that sits outside that for me, if that sits outside that in, you know, I hate to say it, but excel or whatever it is that elixir can share with us and and we can then you know. 1:6:42.140 --> 1:6:43.500 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, manipulate. 1:6:56.370 --> 1:6:57.10 Kolachalam, Madhu So so. 1:6:56.910 --> 1:6:57.270 Vinha, Fernando What?


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the management of inventory and manufacturing processes, specifically the approval of changes by the financial team and the engineering team. The conversation also touches on the complexity of system configurations and the physical management of inventory. The team discusses the integration of three systems: Oracle Elixir, Oracle FMCL, and SAP B1. Fernando Vinha and Kyle Barrington suggest that there may not need to be integration between SAP B1 and Oracle. Barrington proposes that costs can be manually inputted initially, and data outside of this can be managed in Excel or a similar platform.
