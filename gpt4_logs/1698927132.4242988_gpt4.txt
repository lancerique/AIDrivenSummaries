that going forward? 0:22:23.520 --> 0:22:32.920 Osusuluwa, Ejiro We'll be integrated or manage. Would we still do the same thing? So would so for me basically in some way I'm looking at the control bits. The second bit is. 0:22:34.520 --> 0:22:53.80 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Maybe not at this stage, but kind of just for the information the current government is very tax oriented right now. There's a lot of enforcement. I've been going to a couple of tax meetings. There's a bit of grey area pushback with our current model. 0:22:53.690 --> 0:22:56.250 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Of we are buying book. 0:22:57.690 --> 0:23:25.970 Osusuluwa, Ejiro I was selling book to NHPIL. When you look at our audited financials, the sales of bulk is not reported as part of our sales but when applying for input and output VATS, we include that as part of what we have as our revenue. So and the reason why we have to adopt that model. Like Riley said, the bit around managing the working capital and the FX management if we are important. But by the time we go to full. 0:23:26.580 --> 0:23:36.540 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Apojitu we would be doing full localization, so that's that's effects Rick's exposure no longer exist, would we? 0:23:36.380 --> 0:23:40.60 Barrington, Kyle I'll pull. Can I just jump in? So full localization? 0:23:49.170 --> 0:23:50.490 Vinha, Fernando Oh, OK. 0:23:52.920 --> 0:23:53.440 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK. 0:23:41.520 --> 0:23:54.840 Barrington, Kyle Not every material will be able to be procured locally is just to be clear on that. So some items will still need to be imported ajiro just to be clear, not a very small amount, 10% roughly give or take. Just to be clear. 0:23:54.470 --> 0:23:55.30 Vinha, Fernando So. 0:23:54.200 --> 0:23:56.0 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So my concern will be. 0:23:57.110 --> 0:24:0.150 Osusuluwa, Ejiro If we still want to buy. 0:24:1.430 --> 0:24:23.430 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Materials, raw materials and sell to elixir, which elixir would also include in the cost and charge back to us. There is the bit around compliance as to how we manage that bit of the tax implication. What are we recording as revenue because right now the the the Regulatory agency are pushing back on that treatment. 0:24:27.0 --> 0:24:27.160 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. 0:24:40.790 --> 0:24:42.630 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes, yes, yes. 0:24:42.390 --> 0:24:42.750 Vinha, Fernando Phone. 0:24:24.930 --> 0:24:57.690 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. I think I basically there are two areas, right. I think one is the whole costing and visibility of cost. Second is tax compliance and that has multiple dimensions that of input output VAD. What tax we pay, revenue management, working capital impact. So there are multiple dimensions when when we you're saying tax but in terms of particularly when there are intercompany transactions, how do we stay compliant with all the rules as per Nigeria? So that's the second area we need to go deep and map it out. I get that. 0:24:58.240 --> 0:24:59.320 Kolachalam, Madhu Anything else is wrong. 0:25:1.310 --> 0:25:1.350 Vinha, Fernando I. 0:25:1.560 --> 0:25:1.880 Barrington, Kyle Get. 0:25:0.860 --> 0:25:1.900 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And now that's that's all. 0:25:2.620 --> 0:25:3.820 Vinha, Fernando Oh OK 0. 0:25:2.480 --> 0:25:8.840 Barrington, Kyle Can I just answer that the first question from majoro around how we want to do that going forward? 0:25:9.460 --> 0:25:9.740 Kolachalam, Madhu Yes. 0:25:10.280 --> 0:25:13.520 Barrington, Kyle So the the plan and this is, I suppose important. 0:25:23.730 --> 0:25:24.250 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK. 0:25:15.160 --> 0:25:33.80 Barrington, Kyle We would want to have at least the ideal would be that we would have much greater visibility on those variances live, if you will. So we would want a minimum and this is an absolute minimum on a monthly reporting basis, we'd have those variances, so. 0:25:33.640 --> 0:25:38.240 Barrington, Kyle And I can share tea supply chain reporting, but we'll want to know. 0:25:38.280 --> 0:26:3.480 Barrington, Kyle Almost well, this is what our, you know, our budget should have been so normally zero when it comes to T sparking because you budget you to recover your full car and then then you want to track your full variances to that with volume and mix. So your raw material PP vs your packaging material PP vs then your actual factory cost which you can weight you know. 0:26:4.120 --> 0:26:23.240 Barrington, Kyle Repairs and maintenance versus standard. You'll then want to talk about freight etcetera and then there won't be an FX element as well in there. So sort of that's how you'll want to get and will and I suppose my requirement is a must on a monthly basis, we'll be able to report the. 0:26:25.40 --> 0:26:28.680 Barrington, Kyle The foot performance on the factory because the idea is going to be. 0:26:29.0 --> 0:26:35.960 Barrington, Kyle That the factory will effectively sit as a standalone PLA, bit like T supply chain does so at the moment. 0:26:36.280 --> 0:27:5.960
