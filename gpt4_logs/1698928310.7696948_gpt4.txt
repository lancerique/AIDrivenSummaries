Write a concise summary of the following:


track of those changes and, you know, and in terms of. 2:4:49.45 --> 2:4:51.885 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Having an audit trail really something like that. 2:4:53.835 --> 2:4:56.355 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. And and and actually it's it's. 2:4:54.905 --> 2:4:59.145 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. In an ideal world. Oh, sorry. Yeah. I was just gonna say sort. 2:4:58.455 --> 2:4:59.335 Kolachalam, Madhu And a good cat. 2:5:0.875 --> 2:5:5.755 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. Any price change? Almost any price change versus what's been agreed with? 2:5:8.505 --> 2:5:14.985 Barrington, Kyle AJ Rolis or procurement team would be, yeah, go back to our team to approve it effectively is what we're saying. 2:5:16.605 --> 2:5:16.925 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. 2:5:18.845 --> 2:5:19.365 Thiagarajah, Thisan Yeah. 2:5:18.535 --> 2:5:19.615 Barrington, Kyle So basically. 2:5:46.535 --> 2:5:47.15 Barrington, Kyle But you. 2:5:18.665 --> 2:5:50.665 Vinha, Fernando Because Kyle, the head of the procurement, you'll be trying is all employee, not Alexa. OK, we approve supplier, not Alexa. OK, you make the negotiation because we do not have too many raw materials. You are talk about 12 raw materials, OK and some of them some may want to be our global procurement team. We want to do that like Lucas, Coco all these things. So you may make has a contract for 6-7 months. OK. 2:5:52.925 --> 2:5:55.245 Barrington, Kyle Pause. Can I just pause 'cause I I don't I. 2:6:4.955 --> 2:6:6.755 Thiagarajah, Thisan Can I just point out one point then? 2:5:51.775 --> 2:6:10.735 Vinha, Fernando So Alexa doesn't have the power to buy from some supply. We have to approve it first because we have to go to the edge, gold it first if they pass. So you can give the green light. OK. And the head of is twine zone is not Alexa. OK. 2:6:7.665 --> 2:6:16.145 Barrington, Kyle But the but the. But the point is you're not like some suppliers. My point is not that we're not gonna be involved in it is that. 2:6:17.745 --> 2:6:38.785 Barrington, Kyle Elixir, ultimately, is the ones that are paying for it, right? So we're not necessarily in all cases going to have longer term contracts because people in Nigeria are going to not going to be willing to do that with the volatility and inflation, etcetera. So my point is we agree a price for X3 weeks later, the supplier wants to charge X + 5%. 2:6:39.365 --> 2:6:52.965 Barrington, Kyle Like we just need to make sure that the process in place that our procurement team are aware and are happy with that or challenge and push back and it can't just be like, oh, Alexa, just OK, Now we're just buying it at this price. That's my point. 2:6:54.655 --> 2:6:56.535 Ohikhuai, Henry You are correct. Very correct. 2:6:57.965 --> 2:6:58.885 Kolachalam, Madhu And and and Kyl. 2:6:58.555 --> 2:6:59.275 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And because of. 2:6:58.125 --> 2:6:59.365 Thiagarajah, Thisan There's only one more point. 2:7:0.125 --> 2:7:0.925 Kolachalam, Madhu Sorry, go ahead. 2:7:1.315 --> 2:7:5.115 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yeah, because of like the points, Kyrie is a lot of volatility around. 2:7:20.505 --> 2:7:21.345 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, exactly. 2:7:6.555 --> 2:7:26.435 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Fridays and all of that, one of the things we've also done is we have as part of BCP more than one supplier. So it's not just a case that you have one supplier supplying new cats and you could have two or three suppliers that you've registered that you're buying from and these suppliers all have different prices and stuff like that. 2:7:27.995 --> 2:7:39.915 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So. So it's something that, you know I'm looking at, it's something we really need to focus on because it's going to be very key part in terms of your input cost and in and having you know visibility and control around that. 2:7:44.325 --> 2:7:45.965 Thiagarajah, Thisan And do I? Sorry. 2:7:43.975 --> 2:7:47.295 Kolachalam, Madhu The NNN MG I was just thinking, go ahead, go ahead this. 2:7:48.295 --> 2:8:17.535 Thiagarajah, Thisan No, the the only point I was gonna make is around control. So right now there's the whole controller is really in a trust basis right now. And I'm not saying that there's no reason not to trust, but once the price has been agreed, there is a trust element that the person executing that is doing the job right. I haven't seen if there is one then then please let me know. There's a reconciliation that happens versus what did procurement agree and what was actually ordered and was there actually a analysis done as an output to say actually that process is working so. 2:8:18.375 --> 2:8:19.855 Thiagarajah, Thisan That's the bid for me. Was a bit of a concern. 2:8:34.415 --> 2:8:36.815 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, agreed. That's what I was gonna say. Yeah. 2:8:18.415 --> 2:8:56.535 Kolachalam, Madhu At at the end is and I'm actually going even even more proactive control, right? So for example, most systems have something called a blanket agreement which doesn't talk about schedules, quantities work we're
