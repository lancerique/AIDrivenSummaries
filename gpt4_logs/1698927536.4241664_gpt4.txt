and key distributors, they are meant to keep about 45 days. But that information of what they have. 1:34:0.330 --> 1:34:2.90 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Of all the distributors, all the channels. 1:34:2.640 --> 1:34:13.440 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Those information FM chair has it. They have visibility of that. We don't have direct access to that information, they share to us upon request and we review that every every month as well. 1:34:14.850 --> 1:34:18.850 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. OK. So so let's get that's that way. 1:34:17.350 --> 1:34:19.790 Barrington, Kyle And can I assist? Can I listen? 1:34:16.860 --> 1:34:36.60 Ohikhuai, Henry Yeah, but also just to add the the 70 days for now the 70 days is for now in future. I think this may be reviewed because you know we do imports. That's why we have to stick to 70 days when we are producing locally. I don't know if things will change. 1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:40.560 Vinha, Fernando OK. That makes sense. Yeah. Makes sense. 1:34:41.20 --> 1:34:42.540 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yeah, I agree that it makes sense. 1:34:43.390 --> 1:34:43.590 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:46.960 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. 1:34:48.70 --> 1:34:48.190 Barrington, Kyle No. 1:34:55.250 --> 1:34:55.530 Ohikhuai, Henry Yeah. 1:35:1.470 --> 1:35:2.350 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes, we do. 1:35:0.790 --> 1:35:2.590 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes, yes. 1:34:46.30 --> 1:35:4.150 Vinha, Fernando But a zero. I believe you. You you guys have a business, a monthly business review with Fmcl where they share with you with us this mark to sales on KPIs. So you know the the business performs right. 1:35:4.930 --> 1:35:5.810 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes, we do. 1:35:4.790 --> 1:35:6.30 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes, yes. 1:35:6.830 --> 1:35:7.550 Vinha, Fernando Oh, OK. 1:35:9.440 --> 1:35:11.200 Kolachalam, Madhu Hey 0, Henry. How many? 1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:21.40 Kolachalam, Madhu How many countries would we be exporting? Are we exporting today and how many we may export in one year or two years from now? 1:35:24.270 --> 1:35:25.590 Vinha, Fernando Yeah, I've just seen. 1:35:24.630 --> 1:35:29.590 Ohikhuai, Henry I don't have that number of fat for today. Zero. We today 0. 1:35:28.140 --> 1:35:29.700 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Carl, can you provide that? 1:35:27.470 --> 1:35:46.150 Barrington, Kyle I can tell you I can see. I was gonna say it today is 0 by the end of this year. Should be six or seven, I think different countries depending on if we launch in Ghana because it's difficult economic situation. 1:35:47.550 --> 1:35:49.30 Barrington, Kyle And then in two years time. 1:35:50.830 --> 1:35:58.310 Barrington, Kyle It will be much more than that 7 Max 10 if we launch a few other Newmark markets. But yeah, something like that. 1:35:58.160 --> 1:35:59.920 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. Alright. Thanks guys. 1:36:0.120 --> 1:36:7.0 Barrington, Kyle And and I said maybe maybe I was just gonna interject and and and happy to have this conversation, but just I just want to be super clear. 1:36:8.130 --> 1:36:14.10 Barrington, Kyle The the distribution is not changing as a result of Project Apogee 2. 1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:33.760 Glyn-Jones, Hugh Ha. 1:36:15.450 --> 1:36:41.930 Barrington, Kyle So as in setting up the factory, so this discussion is is I'm fine in terms of you know, thinking broader Nigeria, but I just want to be really clear that that's not within the scope of Apogee 2. So yeah, just to be super clear. So if there's talk at the end of this about changing data we get regarding our distribution happy, but that does not fall as part of Apogee 2 and some sure shouldn't come within that scope. Just to be clear. 1:36:42.850 --> 1:37:17.570 Kolachalam, Madhu Go ahead and again, I think that so this may fall into the road map conversation more than the factory or APG conversation, but it gives a good insight on the and some of them. Kyle could be integrated, right? For example, there are tools we deployed before which integrates all this in a common dashboard and it provides the end to end visibility of supply chain and it doesn't cost us some half a million it. And there are solutions out there you could deploy which are like there which can in addition to doing this we could we do that and do we have appetite at at least those are the options I want to be. 1:37:18.330 --> 1:37:18.970 Kolachalam, Madhu Open to discussing. 1:37:22.420 --> 1:37:29.180 Kolachalam, Madhu But but I get it like the priorities on the manufacturing. First we need to make sure that is flawless before we take anything more. 1:37:29.720 --> 1:37:33.800 Thiagarajah, Thisan Nidra do you can you stop sharing, please? If you're not doing something to show, if that's OK? 1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:39.160 Nudrat A Options I'm having with respect to this manufacturing unit. It will allow me just. 1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:51.520 Nudrat A Yeah. So, Kyle, this question with you, typically what we what do we control here. So when when let's say Bining is a, do you know any with the demand? 1:37:52.980 -->


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team discusses their distribution and manufacturing strategies. They currently rely on key distributors and have a 45-day supply, with visibility of this information provided by the FM chair. They review this data monthly. The current 70-day production timeline may be reviewed in the future, especially as they shift to local production. They also conduct a monthly business review with FMCL to monitor business performance. The team is considering exporting to six or seven countries by the end of the year, and possibly more in two years. However, they clarify that these changes are not part of Project Apogee 2. They also discuss the possibility of integrating tools for end-to-end supply chain visibility.
