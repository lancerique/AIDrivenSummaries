PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


things, I suppose are in, in my head a little bit. So, yeah. 2:17:11.375 --> 2:17:13.95 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, I agree. I like. 2:17:12.75 --> 2:17:19.75 Barrington, Kyle It got really helpful. Good, good stuff and it'll be good to sort of keep keep the momentum on this I think would be be my viewpoint. 2:17:20.135 --> 2:17:48.95 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. Yeah. And and Kyle, actually, I don't have answers on it, that's what I'll discuss with eisan. And also I like your input on. Look, I think we have to have a hard priority and there is something we should not wait for getting it like a perfect process like on the manufacturing and some of those things. And the other things where we are talking integrations across platforms, distribution, simplifying that maybe that is second product specification is one thing I as a concept. 2:17:49.415 --> 2:17:55.535 Kolachalam, Madhu Product specification and quality control is a starting point of that I think should be there in a system. 2:17:56.205 --> 2:18:23.485 Kolachalam, Madhu But I don't know what is the resourcing behind because anytime you bring a system it actually asks for lot of information data entry and took maintain it. Are we resource? I think those are the questions I don't but but we'll come back and let me reflect on it. Come and and we'll work with this and to convert this into a plan. And what what do we need to do to deep dive on process mapping defined to be process and work with our other partners to on the next steps. 2:18:24.415 --> 2:18:24.975 Vinha, Fernando OK. 2:18:26.205 --> 2:18:26.605 Vinha, Fernando Right, right. 2:18:27.215 --> 2:18:30.775 Kolachalam, Madhu Any any other input or site feedback or comments from anyone? 2:18:32.85 --> 2:18:53.805 Vinha, Fernando No, I think I think they they need to was great. I think you have a better understand and now I think you could, I think that the big the next what would be the next step it is you have to start to to to read the dial what would be the next step and who you want to take action for each step and to map it a little bit more clear. OK. 2:18:54.475 --> 2:18:54.955 Kolachalam, Madhu Sorry. 2:18:58.925 --> 2:18:59.885 Kolachalam, Madhu Anyone else? 2:19:0.855 --> 2:19:28.135 Thiagarajah, Thisan My perspective really good meeting Karl's been really pushing me a lot to, like, challenging me on my thought process behind the initial scope was we'll just keep as is. So I'm quite glad that we ended up here because actually just listening to everybody talk and I've been hearing this a lot and I don't have the understanding that I need to have to be able to be effective in this space yet. But there is loads of opportunities for improvement. So it's just going to be a question of privatising that and making sure that we can make that into the right timing for golovk. 2:19:29.115 --> 2:19:29.715 Vinha, Fernando OK. 2:19:28.365 --> 2:19:30.165 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, yeah, absolutely. 2:19:31.345 --> 2:20:2.745 Kolachalam, Madhu Excellent. So Sati may I'll, I'll, I'll document all this at least as minutes and notes and then continue working with this on and and the Neil and team to see what do we need to take this forward and kind of generate a requirement spec for alexe to deliver in terms of order of priority and and agree with the stakeholders in twining soltane and then work with them and how do we work I'll we'll have some ideas and then convert that into a plan deliverables and timelines and if October is our target go live then we should be ready with our system. 2:20:3.345 --> 2:20:23.905 Kolachalam, Madhu By July, with buffer time built in August, September, October. So by July, if we have to be ready, we should have our requirements by January at least. So I'm just thinking from manufacturing but, but let's let's let let's put some high level timelines work backwards and work on detailed requirements and and how do we document that taking it forward? 2:20:26.855 --> 2:20:27.175 Vinha, Fernando Clear. 2:20:26.755 --> 2:20:28.475 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Thank you very much, Madam. Thanks. 2:20:30.245 --> 2:20:31.405 Barrington, Kyle Great. Thank you. 2:20:28.635 --> 2:20:32.995 Kolachalam, Madhu Excellent. Thank you all and have a great weekend. Bye. 2:20:31.445 --> 2:20:34.325 Vinha, Fernando OK. Thank you. Bye, bye. 2:20:34.135 --> 2:20:35.775 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Bye, Kyle. Bye, Jacob. 2:20:34.415 --> 2:20:36.215 Nudrat A Thank you. Thank thanks everyone. 2:20:37.215 --> 2:20:37.295 Thiagarajah, Thisan Ha. 2:20:37.345 --> 2:20:39.665 Barrington, Kyle Bye. Yeah. Bye. Bye.

Take care. Bye, Ron.
