0:52:59.840 Joshua Savidge Umm. 0:52:52.40 --> 0:53:4.290 Dempsey Tim So there's there's lots of lean processes we want to bring to the business, but we want to start with getting the basics right, which are, you know, let's at least get the right stock to the right warehouse at the right time. 0:53:4.340 --> 0:53:9.380 Dempsey Tim Then we can build on optimizing it, reducing lead times, et cetera, et cetera. 0:53:9.390 --> 0:53:10.540 Dempsey Tim So we're. 0:53:12.510 --> 0:53:14.80 Dempsey Tim Journeys culture change. 0:53:14.150 --> 0:53:18.240 Dempsey Tim The culture is less commit all our transactions into the system. 0:53:18.710 --> 0:53:18.870 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:53:18.570 --> 0:53:20.580 Dempsey Tim Let's give good forecast information. 0:53:20.910 --> 0:53:22.600 Dempsey Tim Let's have one set of numbers. 0:53:22.850 --> 0:53:35.430 Dempsey Tim Let's have a monthly process, let's say off emails, and let's get all the data in one place and and agreeable process and and it's getting more complex and more difficult to manage. 0:53:35.700 --> 0:53:37.750 Dempsey Tim We're not increasing head count. 0:53:37.820 --> 0:53:40.10 Dempsey Tim The only option we have is technology to help us. 0:53:40.680 --> 0:53:41.760 Pankaj Gadekar Understand. Understand. 0:53:40.340 --> 0:53:42.130 Dempsey Tim Really. Yeah. 0:53:43.570 --> 0:53:44.40 Pankaj Gadekar Sorry. 0:53:44.90 --> 0:53:45.600 Pankaj Gadekar You you had you had. 0:53:55.760 --> 0:53:55.970 Dempsey Tim Mm-hmm. 0:53:56.160 --> 0:53:56.580 Ricciardi Luca Product. 0:53:43.660 --> 0:53:57.870 Ajay Aggarwal I think Pankaj, I think Pankaj the I think the what their main I think we can we can look at starting from demand forecasting and replenishment and what if analysis I think these are three things which they need to start with. Yeah. 0:53:59.50 --> 0:53:59.530 Pankaj Gadekar Fair enough. 0:53:59.340 --> 0:53:59.740 Ricciardi Luca Correct. 0:54:0.920 --> 0:54:1.80 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:54:2.10 --> 0:54:2.340 Ricciardi Luca No. 0:54:2.300 --> 0:54:2.860 Pankaj Gadekar Uh, like. 0:54:22.960 --> 0:54:23.460 Ajay Aggarwal Yes, yes. 0:54:2.350 --> 0:54:33.650 Ricciardi Luca So because I wanted just to add one point just to to clarify, I mean while the replenishments at the warehouse level are done on SKU basis, of course SKU for us means that the deepest detail that we can go to when we we discuss about the product of course, so chemistry, but eight name packaging, net rate and all this kind of stuff when it comes to planning productions, this is done on an aggregated level talking about the camp, about the chemistry itself, not the single SKU because it's too granular. 0:54:33.660 --> 0:54:48.360 Ricciardi Luca And as we were saying before, at the moment, we are not able to link under percent, which means that we will need to and yeah, as I said the the the plan production, I mean the production planning gonna meter Morrison is done on at the grade level. 0:54:48.530 --> 0:54:57.920 Ricciardi Luca So that's what that that's also why starting from making sure that we get the clear input from the warehouse is on the supply plan will help us for sure. 0:54:57.990 --> 0:55:2.300 Ricciardi Luca And then that can be taken as a second step in order to tackle the production issues. 0:55:2.310 --> 0:55:3.220 Ricciardi Luca Let's point this way. 0:55:4.210 --> 0:55:4.350 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:55:6.370 --> 0:55:12.30 Pankaj Gadekar Right now, while crafting an approach which we will try to do at a high level. 0:55:13.20 --> 0:55:20.810 Pankaj Gadekar Uh umm, what are your inputs to us in terms of what are the key consideration that we should keep in mind? 0:55:20.820 --> 0:55:22.680 Pankaj Gadekar What are the constraint that we should be aware? 0:55:23.880 --> 0:55:28.70 Pankaj Gadekar Uh, you know what is the way of typical working right? 0:55:28.260 --> 0:55:33.230 Pankaj Gadekar For example, if we start a project, do you think that you know respective? 0:55:34.780 --> 0:55:43.330 Pankaj Gadekar Stakeholders have enough time to spare with us or it needs to be adjusted according to you know what they need to do day-to-day. 0:55:46.210 --> 0:55:46.660 Dempsey Tim We. 0:55:46.750 --> 0:55:48.890 Dempsey Tim Yeah, it's a good point. 0:55:43.340 --> 0:55:48.980 Pankaj Gadekar You know, this is just the one sample, but other than that, yeah, if you if you can. 0:55:48.900 --> 0:55:49.470 Dempsey Tim It's a good point. 0:55:49.480 --> 0:55:49.930 Dempsey Tim We wouldn't. 0:55:56.540 --> 0:55:56.700 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:55:50.960 --> 0:55:57.610 Dempsey Tim Will not attack a company that says we're gonna do a big project and someone becomes seconded to the project and someone else does their day job. 0:56:0.200 --> 0:56:0.420 Pankaj Gadekar Right. 0:56:6.920 --> 0:56:7.140 Pankaj Gadekar Right. 0:55:57.700 --> 0:56:14.610 Dempsey Tim So we will continue our day jobs with this with this as well, but the core people that you see here and a few other people would be very


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team discussed implementing lean processes in their business, starting with ensuring the right stock is delivered to the right warehouse at the right time. They plan to optimize this process, reduce lead times, and make a cultural shift to commit all transactions into the system. They aim to improve forecast information, have a unified set of numbers, and consolidate all data in one place. As the process becomes more complex and difficult to manage without increasing headcount, they see technology as the only solution. They also discussed starting with demand forecasting, replenishment, and 'what if' analysis. They noted that while warehouse replenishments are done on an SKU basis, production planning is done on an aggregated level. They also discussed the constraints and considerations for implementing these changes, including the time availability of stakeholders.
