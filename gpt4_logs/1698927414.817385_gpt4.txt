Write a concise summary of the following:


example, when twining's entity set sending a purchase order, how does how does do we do we create is it is it based on a customer order like a distribution entity says I need this much quantity of Volt or these products, is it based on that distribution entity we place order on manufacturing or? 1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:36.80 Kolachalam, Madhu Or we just place orders. 1:11:37.560 --> 1:11:42.280 Kolachalam, Madhu Do we do do we do distribute to stock or do we actually distribute to orders? 1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:49.280 Kolachalam, Madhu My actual when I say customer orders the distributor orders, what is the trigger point to place an order on manufacturing? 1:11:51.420 --> 1:12:0.300 Vinha, Fernando Nop, you have to have a nop. Agree. What you're gonna produce and it so you load it, your plan in the system. 1:12:0.590 --> 1:12:4.190 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, but that is to manufacture, but once you manufacture. 1:12:5.790 --> 1:12:11.110 Kolachalam, Madhu Is the is everything that is manufactured becomes Twinings stock. 1:12:12.650 --> 1:12:13.170 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes. 1:12:14.290 --> 1:12:15.890 Vinha, Fernando Yes, I think, yeah. 1:12:15.770 --> 1:12:16.90 Barrington, Kyle I think. 1:12:16.300 --> 1:12:19.700 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So the way the way the model works, the model is that. 1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:36.500 Osusuluwa, Ejiro From the snop, that's one. The alignment is done. We have this ability of the demand and that is sign of whatever the manufacturer Elixir produced that is transferred to. 1:12:38.220 --> 1:12:43.460 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Fmcl, which is our distributor client, it is the invoice for that and we invoice fmcl. 1:12:45.30 --> 1:12:46.550 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So at every point in time. 1:12:45.90 --> 1:12:48.130 Vinha, Fernando Because it the you know. 1:12:44.820 --> 1:12:49.180 Kolachalam, Madhu And and and and is so so he said. I have one question. 1:12:48.210 --> 1:12:49.570 Osusuluwa, Ejiro At every point in time. 1:12:48.170 --> 1:12:49.610 Vinha, Fernando We produce 2 water, right? 1:12:51.30 --> 1:12:52.150 Kolachalam, Madhu Sorry, go ahead send that. 1:12:52.20 --> 1:12:53.300 Ohikhuai, Henry We produce to order. 1:12:53.830 --> 1:13:15.150 Vinha, Fernando Yes, it produced to order because I understand that you have snlp with fmcl fmcl. Please we agree with the the the the volume of by SKU. So it has a grid. So fmsf will you want to issue the the the order to us to to, to, to. 1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:27.600 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yeah, talking. 1:13:16.30 --> 1:13:27.910 Vinha, Fernando You want to order to Alexa and you want to produce it and let you transfer everything to. We don't keep it. Stop wherever you produce you you you send to elect. I think it is there. 1:13:29.290 --> 1:13:30.50 Osusuluwa, Ejiro That's it. 1:13:29.0 --> 1:13:40.120 Kolachalam, Madhu But but but Fernando, do we produce to demand based on snlp planning or is it that production is only based on a order? I I think it is a based on demand estimation, right? 1:13:41.280 --> 1:13:42.440 Osusuluwa, Ejiro It's based on the demand. 1:13:41.740 --> 1:13:43.580 Ohikhuai, Henry It's based on the my destination. 1:13:44.0 --> 1:13:44.480 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 1:13:45.260 --> 1:14:2.260 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. But then how do you invoice basically, does Twinings create a a purchase order on Alexa today or the model is you you don't look at apo everything you produce, you immediately transfer the ownership to Twinings and invoice then? 1:14:2.990 --> 1:14:3.390 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes. 1:14:3.980 --> 1:14:4.740 Vinha, Fernando Yes. 1:14:4.110 --> 1:14:25.550 Ohikhuai, Henry No, Elysia generates apo that is issued. No Fmcr is a PU that is issued to Alesia. Based on that PO Alesia produce that quantity and invoice to Twinings Twinings issue invoice to to fmci. 1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:36.320 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, but fmcl is not actually means they've means physically. Their team may be raising APO, but actually they are raising I guess on behalf of Joinings. 1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:41.400 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes, they are reasonably. 1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:42.920 Kolachalam, Madhu Right. It's not FNCL is not the legal entity go it is. 1:14:43.630 --> 1:14:43.750 Ohikhuai, Henry It. 1:14:40.130 --> 1:14:46.170 Osusuluwa, Ejiro No. So so madel that is raised in the system? 1:14:47.610 --> 1:15:2.410 Osusuluwa, Ejiro For Twinings to issue to new and to fmcli think the challenge sometimes we've had. Maybe that's where that consistency has not been is because sometimes there's flexibility. 1:15:3.850 --> 1:15:23.170 Osusuluwa, Ejiro They they they the plan changes in terms of quantity, but the system allows the processes POS are raised in the system which is issue that's based on the outcome of the S and OP. So POS are raised based on the outcome of the S&OP meeting and that is locked at in the system for both twins. 1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:26.0 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And Alexia and Fmcr as well. 1:15:39.560 --> 1:15:39.920 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes. 1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:40.600


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the process of placing orders in a manufacturing context. The trigger point to place an order on manufacturing is based on customer orders or distributor orders. The manufacturing process is based on a Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) model, where the demand is estimated and the production is planned accordingly. Once the products are manufactured, they become part of Twinings' stock. The model works in such a way that whatever is produced is transferred to FMCL, their distributor client, and they are invoiced for it. The production is based on demand estimation and not solely on orders. The invoicing process involves Twinings creating a purchase order on Alexa, and everything produced is immediately transferred to Twinings and invoiced. FMCL raises a purchase order on behalf of Twinings, and Twinings then issues an invoice to FMCL.
