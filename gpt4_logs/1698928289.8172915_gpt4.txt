Write a concise summary of the following:


price that's been agreed by procurement before they place that order for FMC order. I just wanted to talk about that because I think. 2:0:11.225 --> 2:0:23.785 Thiagarajah, Thisan Like you mentioned K2, so again need to understand what K2 actually does, but I'm thinking like a system like K2 could hopefully manage that inventory, sorry, not inventory process the supplier process. 2:0:24.605 --> 2:0:27.925 Kolachalam, Madhu So actually that's a good part. I got. Go ahead. Go ahead. 2:0:24.705 --> 2:0:29.985 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And and just. OK, I just wanted to add something to what the son said regarding. 2:0:32.745 --> 2:0:41.945 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Raw material and packaging material purchase. We have full control around negotiation with the supplier. 2:0:43.745 --> 2:0:54.65 Osusuluwa, Ejiro We have a procurement team in Twining, which is managed by China. He does the negotiation interaction with the supplier and once. 2:0:54.875 --> 2:0:59.195 Osusuluwa, Ejiro He finalised with pricing and all of that. He communicates that to Alicia. 2:1:6.445 --> 2:1:8.485 Barrington, Kyle I want that OK yeah. 2:1:0.325 --> 2:1:26.805 Osusuluwa, Ejiro The warehouse manager and based on that communication of what the prices are, the warehouse manager is able to read the PO in Oracle to the supplier. So just to to have to the point to send said if if it's something that we can have a management to that manage the entire process that flow that come integrated directly into. 2:1:28.365 --> 2:1:32.165 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Alicia or directly system, where the warehouse manager at every point in time. 2:1:32.785 --> 2:1:36.185 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And the visibility to get that direct final? 2:1:37.625 --> 2:2:3.185 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Information of price negotiation with the supplier, which will would have finalised or negotiated meet and get those visibility rather than just relying on e-mail communications and of that. So I don't know what Kate Soup is able to do or what tools we have, but it you know something around that procurement big that can be integrated weed their leagues there too because now we're looking at a lot of a lot of. 2:2:4.745 --> 2:2:7.225 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Roman materials and public package of materials, right? 2:2:8.205 --> 2:2:25.45 Kolachalam, Madhu So, so so is, you know, so I have a question, right. So if it keeps systems out for eminent functionally do going forward will all supplier contract and pricing negotiations, would that be done always by Twinings or team? 2:2:27.5 --> 2:2:29.325 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Skype. I know. Currently it's done by. 2:2:31.35 --> 2:2:31.555 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes. 2:2:32.595 --> 2:2:33.275 Vinha, Fernando Yes. 2:2:32.895 --> 2:2:33.415 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 2:2:34.85 --> 2:2:34.645 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes. 2:2:34.455 --> 2:2:43.975 Kolachalam, Madhu OK, so so great, right? So I'm just thinking conceptually right. For example, let us say somebody on Andy's team, does the negotiations with 25 suppliers for 25. 2:2:42.855 --> 2:2:46.495 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Please, I don't if that's, we tend to do going forward. 2:2:49.355 --> 2:2:49.955 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 2:2:49.85 --> 2:2:51.965 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, we'll we'll want to be involved. Yeah, yeah. 2:2:48.815 --> 2:2:55.135 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes, because it's impart our inputs, it's impart our inputs. So we would like to always do that. 2:2:57.605 --> 2:3:6.605 Kolachalam, Madhu So, so and and if you are, if you are doing that, let us say Andy's team does the negotiation agreed on contracts and all. And now the question is, is? 2:3:7.605 --> 2:3:21.245 Kolachalam, Madhu Is the challenge that that information on pricing negotiation is coming through mails or is it the transactional of fulfilment of purchase orders raising on suppliers, collaboration with suppliers, which is the bigger challenge? 2:3:24.925 --> 2:3:53.685 Ohikhuai, Henry The order is not a big it's not a big challenge. Nether is a big challenge, but the issue is that currently you need to do it to call audits for the supplier. Once you are done with technical audits, you can now give approval by e-mail to Alicia. So if PPO to the vendor or to start buying from the vendor periodically prices change the negotiation or price change. 2:3:53.725 --> 2:4:15.685 Ohikhuai, Henry Is not done with. Alessia is always done with and it's in which is fine. So periodically until the next earthquality happens, these prices change from time to time, sometimes every other week. So because it's an input for our own cost, we want to be involved in the pricing negotiation. 2:4:17.265 --> 2:4:19.625 Osusuluwa, Ejiro I think from my end the beach will be around. 2:4:21.225 --> 2:4:39.585 Osusuluwa, Ejiro This information readily being available to the finance team in terms of having visibility around price changes and all of that and also around if we rather than having like an Excel base to track all of this if. 2:4:41.425 --> 2:4:48.25 Osusuluwa, Ejiro That we're the same to can, you know, help keep


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team discussed the procurement process for FMC orders, specifically the negotiation of prices with suppliers. The procurement team, managed by China, handles the negotiation and communicates the final prices to Alicia, the warehouse manager. The team expressed a desire for a system, possibly like K2, to manage this process and provide visibility of price negotiations, rather than relying on email communications. The team also discussed the possibility of integrating this procurement process with their existing systems. The importance of the finance team having visibility of price changes was also highlighted.
