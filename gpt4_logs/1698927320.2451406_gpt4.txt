Write a concise summary of the following:


Alexa do that in Oracle currently? 0:57:48.480 --> 0:57:50.520 Ohikhuai, Henry Currently we do it once in a month. 0:57:51.750 --> 0:57:55.470 Kolachalam, Madhu But it is done in Oracle Alexa does it in Oracle system. 0:57:55.930 --> 0:57:57.130 Ohikhuai, Henry Correct, correct. 0:57:57.590 --> 0:57:57.790 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 0:57:56.780 --> 0:58:6.660 Kolachalam, Madhu No. And where does the variances go? Because if they don't have below materials or maybe they do, I don't know how it is set up currently, but of of course, OK, we we can. 0:58:5.370 --> 0:58:28.530 Ohikhuai, Henry No, they they wastage when they count. If there are difference maybe a negative variance it goes into wastage. This goes into the cost of a production. H0 can give more details about this which is part of the liable wastage which the business and then we can use this as standard cost at the end of the day maybe a Giro can give you some more explanation on that. 0:58:26.410 --> 0:58:59.290 Vinha, Fernando It it it, it goes to the material user variance. OK, I think they start the proceed process is to do is once a month of course because I'm running the the business by month so end of the month you close right is correct. You have to count all physical you have and compare with your system OK and if you have variance you have to adjust the system may want to give you the variance later it is should be accordingly standard. It is your ecto OK. 0:58:59.520 --> 0:59:18.240 Vinha, Fernando So you do it in quantity as well as in value. OK, based on your act and then based on your standard material price and so you can take the actual, I think it's the normal processor using every factory we do it just once a month. I do not see the needs to do it. 0:59:20.80 --> 0:59:33.120 Vinha, Fernando Every week, because our our process is continuous, OK is it is back is because it's 24 hours full process. You cannot stop our process. Of course spec. Yes, but the the manufacturer process is running 24. 0:59:33.570 --> 0:59:36.490 Vinha, Fernando OK, just just keep it going, OK? 0:59:37.590 --> 0:59:39.30 Vinha, Fernando This is the the way you. 0:59:37.960 --> 0:59:41.280 Kolachalam, Madhu No, I I I think it I go ahead is wrong. 0:59:43.460 --> 1:0:4.20 Osusuluwa, Ejiro To answer the points Emin raised in the Bill of Material Design allowable wasted to have been built in the bomb so that is captured in the bomb. But when there is a positive variance or a negative variance, all that attached to the wastage usage variance GL. 1:0:4.300 --> 1:0:13.140 Osusuluwa, Ejiro My suggestion or take will be for those application tools that you've mentioned, because today we're just looking at about. 1:0:13.990 --> 1:0:14.870 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Maybe. 1:0:16.340 --> 1:0:23.860 Osusuluwa, Ejiro About 10 materials or so, a raw material which is bulk and packaging materials by the time we go into the. 1:0:25.940 --> 1:0:49.420 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Local full localization. The number of materials will be a lot. Currently one of the things we are working on as a business is to try and see how we bring in tools that will make us more efficient, reduce man intervention and you know, improve efficiency. So if this suggests to these tools can be integrated into our system, into our applications and we look at the cost benefit. 1:0:50.30 --> 1:1:2.830 Osusuluwa, Ejiro It and it's not something that will take so much time. I think it's something we should be open to and try and see how we can also implement that to thus improve our process, because we don't institutionally by. 1:1:2.870 --> 1:1:19.30 Osusuluwa, Ejiro While currently we do what we're doing, but I can tell you that most of these dispelling activities are underlying are manually based. But if we can get tools that are going to automate these things, make us more efficient, I think it's something we could also explore and look at. 1:1:20.290 --> 1:1:21.770 Kolachalam, Madhu It agrees, though I think I think. 1:1:20.410 --> 1:1:52.970 Vinha, Fernando OK. Just one moment on that. I think it once you have agreed on the standards, the standard bill of material, it cannot be changed has to be at least for one year because the financial guys are going to use this is done there. They standard bill of material they standard cost to do their budget for next year. I want to tell them or look guys it is my standard for the next year. So they run it in business, OK, the budget you have and I think based on their standard and so you cannot at least yeah that's countries we you are not allowed to touch. 1:2:6.190 --> 1:2:7.30 Kolachalam, Madhu Unless it is. 1:1:53.500 --> 1:2:23.820 Vinha, Fernando In the Bill of material, just if everyone is agree and it must be just once a year in case you agree because you is not, is not normal to change the bill of material and then they start the Bill of Mater. Yes, unless you have to justify it very, very, very well or who are you cannot believe as Pakistan what is going on who could


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the use of Oracle Alexa in their system, which is done once a month. They discuss the handling of variances, which are accounted for as wastage and factored into the cost of production. The process is continuous, running 24 hours, and any changes to the standard bill of materials must be agreed upon and are typically only done once a year. The team also discusses the potential for integrating new tools to improve efficiency and reduce manual intervention, especially as the number of materials increases. However, any changes to the standard bill of materials must be justified and agreed upon, as it impacts the financial budgeting for the next year.
