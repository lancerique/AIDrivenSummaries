Kolachalam, Madhu So so is it, I guess what I'm asking, maybe you or Henry is see at the end based on a demand planning and a pitch includes actual orders forecast and multiple things, the production is happening and when the inventory is produced. 1:15:41.770 --> 1:15:56.130 Kolachalam, Madhu When does the ownership of inventory gets transferred to Twinings? Is it at the point of finished good completion, immediately shift it and the ownership goes? Or is it you wait for an order to come from Twinings and then you transfer the inventory ownership? 1:15:56.750 --> 1:16:5.790 Osusuluwa, Ejiro No. So it it happens immediately. It's almost like simultaneously because the the Fmcl warehouse is right at the at the factory, so. 1:16:7.350 --> 1:16:12.630 Osusuluwa, Ejiro When Nhpi raises the other in the system and. 1:16:14.630 --> 1:16:23.110 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Transferred to FMC, the transfer, the physical goods to fmcl in the system, there is a way beyond an invoice to. 1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:26.280 Ohikhuai, Henry Tonight. 1:16:37.170 --> 1:16:37.970 Ohikhuai, Henry New voice. 1:16:24.940 --> 1:16:39.620 Osusuluwa, Ejiro To 20s and we get that and based on the invoice and the way we we've gotten from NHPIL, we raise our own invoice and we invoice to fmcl. 1:16:41.40 --> 1:16:41.800 Ohikhuai, Henry Offensive. 1:16:40.820 --> 1:16:43.500 Kolachalam, Madhu You got it. So what about? Yeah, so. 1:16:48.10 --> 1:16:48.930 Ohikhuai, Henry I fancy up. 1:16:49.680 --> 1:16:50.160 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:51.760 Osusuluwa, Ejiro But physically, but physically good, physically, the goods are moved to FMC Warehouse, which is which is located in the factory. So what triggers? 1:16:53.660 --> 1:16:58.100 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Invoicing from NHP elixir to 20S is transfer. 1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:11.800 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. Now one more question left will let's take another country other than Nigeria. Can you give an example, another African entity which we which we are selling currently or we are going to sell? 1:17:12.510 --> 1:17:12.870 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So. 1:17:13.890 --> 1:17:14.490 Ohikhuai, Henry Camera room. 1:17:17.130 --> 1:17:17.690 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 1:17:20.220 --> 1:17:21.740 Kolachalam, Madhu So yeah. 1:17:13.990 --> 1:17:22.590 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So let's take Liberia, for example, and in case of Liberia and OK Cameroon, so in the case of Cameroon. 1:17:23.260 --> 1:17:23.620 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 1:17:25.220 --> 1:17:26.420 Osusuluwa, Ejiro We would. 1:17:25.490 --> 1:17:29.330 Kolachalam, Madhu So in case of cake, yeah, so. So go ahead. Go ahead. 1:17:30.220 --> 1:17:31.100 Ohikhuai, Henry Ask a question. 1:17:29.780 --> 1:17:32.940 Osusuluwa, Ejiro When we will receive. 1:17:37.850 --> 1:17:39.410 Kolachalam, Madhu Sorry, zero, you're breaking up. 1:17:40.420 --> 1:18:9.180 Ohikhuai, Henry Is breaking, so when we receive order from Cameroon, the Twinings will check the that the customer is credit worthy or if they can't get the goose. Once they have done all due diligence on the 20th end, that order will be sent to Alessia to process or to produce. After production, based on the agreed date, that product will be ready for pick up. 1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:29.360 Ohikhuai, Henry The production is executed so the pickup is done or the legal entity transaction is done and then we can ship that products to them in Cameroon. Why the financial transaction continue in FMC in Twining's account? 1:18:30.810 --> 1:18:36.650 Kolachalam, Madhu But and and and Henry, when you say the production is based on an order from Cameroon distribution entity. 1:18:37.970 --> 1:18:47.170 Kolachalam, Madhu Do you wait for only? Do you produce only on actual orders? I thought you you produce based on demand, not just orders or or you produce only on orders. 1:18:53.270 --> 1:18:53.430 Barrington, Kyle Yep. 1:18:49.190 --> 1:18:56.950 Ohikhuai, Henry We produce only on order because take, for instance, Mr. A in Cameroon ask for. 1:18:58.630 --> 1:19:21.70 Ohikhuai, Henry Two containers of a particular SKU, we have a lead time of between four to six weeks to execute that order for Mr. A. So in Cameroon. So when this order come, we are going to check that this order we can fulfil and then the customer is credit worthy. 1:19:21.620 --> 1:19:37.460 Ohikhuai, Henry Until this is done, we cannot execute the production. It is after all this due diligence have been performed. That is when a A notice will be issued to Alicia to execute the production to fulfil that order. 1:19:38.550 --> 1:19:43.150 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the transfer of inventory ownership and production processes. The ownership of inventory is transferred to Twinings immediately after production, with the physical goods moved to the FMC Warehouse located in the factory. The trigger for invoicing from NHP elixir to Twinings is the transfer. The production process is based on actual orders, not just demand. For instance, in Cameroon, an order is received, creditworthiness is checked, and then the order is sent to Alessia for production. The product is then ready for pick up based on the agreed date. In Nigeria, production is based on demand agreed upon during the S and OP meeting.
