everything you do to the system, you set up your expect in the system when you change it, it changes automatically. You will see the reason you are changing. So every ticket and I'm I'm not sure if Alexa has the quality control model. If something that you have to check out I'm I guess they don't have it. 1:51:22.700 --> 1:51:25.220 Vinha, Fernando OK. It's something that you have to look into it. 1:51:25.140 --> 1:51:26.460 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK, just to clarify. 1:51:28.100 --> 1:51:40.180 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Alexia does not have that. What Eligia has is Oracle system in the Oracle system, in the quality model. That parameter that's been put in there for. 1:51:41.940 --> 1:51:43.740 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Quality control, for example. 1:51:45.420 --> 1:51:57.580 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Each time you produce for the products, when it's one, the job order is completed. In Oracle it moves to quarantine location, which the quality guys have access to. 1:51:58.220 --> 1:52:4.180 Osusuluwa, Ejiro But according to guys, to be able to relieve that, they need to check that in terms of the quality controls that. 1:52:16.740 --> 1:52:17.340 Vinha, Fernando I am playing. 1:52:5.740 --> 1:52:27.420 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Kpi. Then benchmark they have, they've checked and all of that is fine before they release the product from quarantine location to finished goods. As regard eligia, having access to our recipe, no they don't. We have the quality control manager sitting in Eligia who is in charge of quality control. 1:52:28.350 --> 1:52:33.710 Osusuluwa, Ejiro He has said in information as to, for example, they. 1:52:36.30 --> 1:52:42.30 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Document that are coming from China as to the bulk raw material and. 1:52:43.910 --> 1:52:58.830 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Parameters that need to be checked. The microbial analysis that have been done, which he also when he gets the material it needs to do all of those check as well in terms of microbial analysis and all of that. And because he also interfaces with NAFTA which is really great. 1:53:29.20 --> 1:53:29.740 Vinha, Fernando Yes. 1:52:59.390 --> 1:53:30.750 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Regulatory agency, yeah, locally there's certain level of formation it needs to provide to navdag based on request and all of this problem manage information will probably be getting from every the guys in China which are provided to invite e-mail. So it's not like we have the the kind of tools that is being used in ABF Shanghai in terms of managing our recipe and all those information. Elixir doesn't have that to an access to some information. 1:53:31.920 --> 1:54:2.520 Vinha, Fernando I understand that you they have because it is normal. What you have is the quality control location but not the in your ERT system. You could create a location that call quality control. All we put raw materials come first to the quality control. Then he leads into the web. How the location leads to the working process location. When you place your products order the same applied to the finished good is it's like the flow I sent to you this size exactly like that and they finish it good also go straight. 1:54:27.75 --> 1:54:27.275 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Oh. 1:54:2.840 --> 1:54:33.800 Vinha, Fernando Today, quite control location and so the guys he leaves it and after he leaves you can sell it product in the quality control location cannot be used not for the product as well as to to sell OK. It is block just quad control team has access to the quant control location and you want more in the factory in the business to assure food safety. OK and but we have to see if you're gonna bring in the. 1:54:34.320 --> 1:55:7.720 Vinha, Fernando Switch control module that is totally different than power control location, so the part control model you can input all your spec you input your materials, the specification you can use automatically the certificate of analysis when you want to import for direct from the system. So the quad control model has all COA. There is always specification. All that parameters you have to to to to to meet to release the product or to release material. It's something that's a question mark. If you want to. 1:55:8.50 --> 1:55:13.250 Vinha, Fernando Ask Alexa to to to buy this model for us or not. OK. 1:55:12.985 --> 1:55:28.345 Kolachalam, Madhu So, so and and and and Fernando actually look, I don't know, not only Alexa, we have actually a quality control or a product data management tool called spec PDM. Whether we should roll out or not is a question we need to discuss. Switzerland uses it. 1:55:29.825 --> 1:55:47.265 Kolachalam, Madhu UK and Poland use it. China is still on word and manual tools in SharePoint and other. So China doesn't have the actually quality control tool currently, but they want this tool and that they're actually reaching out to my team to roll it out. Muriel on my team is looking at that. 1:55:47.645 --> 1:56:0.685 Kolachalam, Madhu So we do have a solution which is a global solution across all the


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the quality control system in place for a product. The system automatically adjusts to changes made, and every change is recorded. Alexa does not have a quality control model, but Eligia uses the Oracle system. In this system, once a job order is completed, it moves to a quarantine location for quality checks before being released to finished goods. The quality control manager in Eligia is in charge of these checks, which include microbial analysis. The manager also interfaces with a local regulatory agency, providing necessary information. The discussion also touches on the possibility of implementing a quality control module that can automatically input specifications and certificates of analysis. A tool called spec PDM, used in Switzerland, UK, and Poland, is suggested as a potential solution.
