PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


price for for this package or not, it is end of the month I just bought print out the PPV for me ppvs or price purchase variance. It's done the version of what I have paid off so I can call to FMC and say look guys, what's going on? What could could you do because it is much higher than they standard so. 0:35:25.690 --> 0:35:30.490 Vinha, Fernando You'll and also at the end of the day, you have to make these provisions because. 0:35:38.690 --> 0:35:38.890 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. 0:35:40.770 --> 0:35:41.410 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 0:35:31.720 --> 0:35:51.240 Vinha, Fernando The after every quarter you have to do a chew up, so you need to know how much I have to pay to these people to make a provision to pay that. I think this is exactly the system we have in Brazil because in Brazil also running two dirty parties exactly like that every month they send to me all variances. I just look into it. 0:35:50.490 --> 0:36:6.810 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. I I I think the Brazil, the the uniqueness in Brazil Fernando, is that your localizations and tax localizations, I think is very unique as you know. And when you go to the second portion that E 0 talked about, that's pretty complex in Brazil. 0:36:7.330 --> 0:36:8.50 Vinha, Fernando Oh, OK. 0:36:8.290 --> 0:36:17.770 Kolachalam, Madhu But, but it'll be good to understand Nigeria complexity of taxation at transaction level. That's a whole area we need to look at holistically in terms of localization needs. Yeah on that. 0:36:15.800 --> 0:36:27.480 Vinha, Fernando I'm getting I'm getting about tax. I cannot say anythings because I don't know how does it work. Of course is that is the area of attention having to understand it very well, I agree. OK. 0:36:29.260 --> 0:36:35.20 Kolachalam, Madhu And I sorry, now, sorry you had your hand up can can can you can Google? 0:36:58.160 --> 0:36:58.400 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. 0:37:0.880 --> 0:37:1.440 Kolachalam, Madhu Absolutely. 0:36:36.450 --> 0:37:3.650 Nudrat A Yeah. So I believe I have got the answer. So I wanted to understand the nature of the selection, so especially how they are dealing with because see tracking mostly Fernando's requirement is with respect to the costing, right. So if if they are working as a third party, surely there should be you know some way in order to share it either we'll be maintaining in our system or not at least what type of data we'll getting from that. So I believe I got my answer. Yeah go ahead. 0:37:3.370 --> 0:37:5.130 Kolachalam, Madhu Thank you, Nader Israel. 0:37:10.810 --> 0:37:12.210 Kolachalam, Madhu Israel, you have your hand up. 0:37:14.710 --> 0:37:14.990 Vinha, Fernando Is. 0:37:15.520 --> 0:37:15.600 Kolachalam, Madhu Oh. 0:37:16.470 --> 0:37:23.990 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes, OK, yes. So what I just wanted to add like you already said. 0:37:24.30 --> 0:37:29.230 Osusuluwa, Ejiro This ERP system actually both SAP and Oracle have all the functionality that Fernandez talked about. 0:37:30.710 --> 0:37:32.350 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And based on experience. 0:37:34.190 --> 0:37:41.630 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Because when I was in Eligia I made use of Oracle and all these already embedded in Oracle. 0:37:43.270 --> 0:37:48.270 Osusuluwa, Ejiro As it as it stands, the way it works is every who is their patient. 0:37:49.220 --> 0:37:51.420 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Manager has access to Oracle. 0:37:53.140 --> 0:37:57.940 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And he can get to see those reports and all of that. 0:37:59.380 --> 0:38:5.900 Osusuluwa, Ejiro The point I'm just trying to look at is Kyle mentioned the bit around we would like to have like. 0:38:7.660 --> 0:38:13.100 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Full access and control if possible, like a live live. 0:38:14.940 --> 0:38:17.580 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Data access and reports. 0:38:19.280 --> 0:38:32.600 Osusuluwa, Ejiro I'm just wondering how we'll be able to achieve that. That's where I'm keen or interested in finding out because as it is, every is able to access Oracle from a different system, not even on its own system. 0:38:34.160 --> 0:38:39.720 Osusuluwa, Ejiro He he has a different desktop where that is he's able to access that from and it doesn't have. 0:38:41.760 --> 0:38:46.480 Osusuluwa, Ejiro We can access that directly from his system, so he needs to log into like Eligia's own. 0:38:48.280 --> 0:38:50.720 Osusuluwa, Ejiro System to be able to get to get access to that. 0:38:51.200 --> 0:38:58.720 Osusuluwa, Ejiro If we want full control, or whether the users that we want to have access or full control. 0:39:0.280 --> 0:39:11.520 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Will be able to integrate that into our system so that we'll achieve that result of being able to have like almost like a a live environment. Access to to that data and information. 0:39:13.130 --> 0:39:15.90 Barrington, Kyle Maybe come clarify? 0:39:14.550 --> 0:39:15.150 Ohikhuai, Henry Yeah. 0:39:12.930 --> 0:39:15.410 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, and and it's so I think sorry, Kyle, but. 0:39:16.770 --> 0:39:16.850 Barrington, Kyle It.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the complexities of price purchase variance (PPV), taxation, and the need for a system to manage these aspects. The participants discuss the need for a system that can handle the unique tax localizations in Brazil and Nigeria. They also discuss the need for a system that can provide live data access and reports. The functionality of both SAP and Oracle in handling these requirements is mentioned. The conversation also touches on the need to understand the nature of the selection, especially how third parties are dealing with costing.
