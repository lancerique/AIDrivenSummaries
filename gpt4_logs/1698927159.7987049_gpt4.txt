collaboration with operations. 0:13:21.400 --> 0:13:28.830 Dempsey Tim When we sit down on a monthly basis in an SOP kind of information sharing environment to form a consensus forecast. 0:13:29.140 --> 0:13:34.110 Dempsey Tim So it is on an Excel based system at the moment. 0:13:34.180 --> 0:13:34.610 Dempsey Tim That's how. 0:13:34.620 --> 0:13:36.970 Dempsey Tim That's how the data is gathered that initial process. 0:13:39.150 --> 0:13:39.760 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:13:39.840 --> 0:13:41.320 Pankaj Gadekar No thanks. 0:13:41.330 --> 0:13:42.360 Pankaj Gadekar Thanks for that information. 0:13:44.250 --> 0:13:50.370 Pankaj Gadekar So do you look into your sales history plus what is the business aspiration? 0:13:59.540 --> 0:13:59.730 Ricciardi Luca Yeah. 0:14:0.470 --> 0:14:0.690 Dempsey Tim Mm-hmm. 0:13:51.80 --> 0:14:1.250 Pankaj Gadekar And this could be the internal things, but what are the external factors that you look into or what are the external factors that the sales people can do in coming up with those numbers? 0:14:1.930 --> 0:14:2.300 Ricciardi Luca Yeah. 0:14:2.400 --> 0:14:3.50 Ajay Aggarwal OK. 0:14:2.310 --> 0:14:3.510 Ricciardi Luca So the the, the the thing. 0:14:3.210 --> 0:14:5.890 Ajay Aggarwal Because I think punk is, they're not looking at history. 0:14:5.900 --> 0:14:10.800 Ajay Aggarwal There because he said there is non statistical, they're only looking at sales plan you know. 0:14:10.580 --> 0:14:12.580 Dempsey Tim Now we are looking at history. 0:14:12.700 --> 0:14:14.870 Dempsey Tim The the file is none. 0:14:14.940 --> 0:14:19.890 Dempsey Tim It's basically not updating itself based off statistical algorithm. 0:14:20.480 --> 0:14:20.760 Ajay Aggarwal OK. 0:14:20.140 --> 0:14:23.60 Dempsey Tim We are manually updating it, but we do consider history. 0:14:24.920 --> 0:14:25.550 Ajay Aggarwal OK. 0:14:25.640 --> 0:14:29.100 Ajay Aggarwal And the second thing which is asking, is there any seasonal impact? 0:14:29.850 --> 0:14:30.380 Ricciardi Luca Exactly. 0:14:30.390 --> 0:14:33.280 Ricciardi Luca No, I I got this idea and now I understood the question. 0:14:33.290 --> 0:14:36.600 Ricciardi Luca So I and this is something that I was missing from my introduction to be honest. 0:14:36.900 --> 0:14:48.390 Ricciardi Luca And I mean the environment is so and different in terms of the the markets that we're currently serving that in some cases we have seen seasonality to be considered. 0:14:52.800 --> 0:14:53.30 Dempsey Tim Umm. 0:14:48.400 --> 0:14:54.510 Ricciardi Luca But at the moment this is not calculated the automatically as column was saying by the the forecast itself. 0:14:55.0 --> 0:14:59.190 Ricciardi Luca In other cases, we don't need to because the the the demand is not. 0:15:0.580 --> 0:15:0.820 Dempsey Tim Yeah. 0:14:59.460 --> 0:15:8.850 Ricciardi Luca I mean, there is no seasonality and or our let's say demand depends on the market environment we are in, in the sense of a competition. 0:15:8.860 --> 0:15:12.880 Ricciardi Luca So it can be that and we are in or out depending on the competition as well. 0:15:12.890 --> 0:15:21.560 Ricciardi Luca So I it's extremely difficult to say to to find only one thing to to assume for seasonality for example. 0:15:21.570 --> 0:15:38.360 Ricciardi Luca So we won't most likely we will need to adapt it to many, many cases, which is the biggest and let's say threat that we have at the moment in implementing this kind of airport potential mathematical system for for custom because the, the the dynamics are so different. 0:15:38.370 --> 0:15:41.660 Ricciardi Luca And then let's say yeah, different. 0:15:41.670 --> 0:15:43.730 Ricciardi Luca That it's extremely tough to find. 0:15:45.460 --> 0:15:46.510 Ricciardi Luca A good best fit. 0:15:46.580 --> 0:15:47.180 Ricciardi Luca Let's put it this way. 0:15:45.820 --> 0:15:52.810 Dempsey Tim Yeah, we, we we have a lot of velocity changes in sales that don't necessarily repeat each other each year. 0:15:53.0 --> 0:16:11.500 Dempsey Tim So that's why it's quite hard to form a trend year on year and there's a lot of as as we know at the moment, a lot of that curve, macro economic, worldwide, things happening over the last three years that really I think even any company in previous companies I worked with, I was working in a pharmaceutical company during COVID. 0:16:11.680 --> 0:16:18.250 Dempsey Tim We had to freeze all all statistical models because everything was, yeah, very unpredictable. 0:16:18.260 --> 0:16:25.470 Dempsey Tim So there's a I think it's a product by product basis, probably there is a few things that would work quite well. 0:16:25.840 --> 0:16:33.170 Dempsey Tim But yeah, as a as a top level kind of volume we we have a lot of velocity changes that don't repeat themselves, yeah. 0:16:33.870 --> 0:16:34.70 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:16:36.170 --> 0:17:0.190 Ricciardi Luca But again, in terms of the process, just to conclude, there's a column was saying, I mean we have a sort of a


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team holds monthly meetings to form a consensus forecast, using an Excel-based system to gather data. They consider both sales history and business aspirations in their forecasting. While they manually update the system and consider historical data, the system does not update itself based on a statistical algorithm. Seasonality is considered in some cases, but not automatically calculated by the forecast. The demand depends on the market environment and competition. The team acknowledges the difficulty in forming a trend year on year due to various macroeconomic factors and velocity changes in sales.
