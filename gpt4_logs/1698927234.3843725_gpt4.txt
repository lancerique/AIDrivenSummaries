0:39:16.750 --> 0:39:21.670 Ohikhuai, Henry You are spot on. Is part of one of the discussion we already did with Texas and Nick. 0:39:23.70 --> 0:39:30.510 Ohikhuai, Henry To have opportunity to have Oracle on our own system as against this situation we have now. 0:39:32.30 --> 0:39:43.70 Ohikhuai, Henry The proposal is that all the system that will be used in this factory will be owned by TWINIES. That's our current proposal. But Tesan and Denik they are still working on this. 0:39:43.450 --> 0:40:4.650 Ohikhuai, Henry So if we own the system, then we will have opportunity to have Oracle on that system. We are also proposing that people working in working, not minding that they are elicia staff. They may have Twinings e-mail. That's another proposal, but it's not fixed yet. We are just discussing so many opportunity to make life easy for us. 0:40:6.670 --> 0:40:6.990 Kolachalam, Madhu And. 0:40:6.10 --> 0:40:8.490 Barrington, Kyle And I just jump in on a couple of things. 0:40:10.50 --> 0:40:33.10 Barrington, Kyle So so ajiro I I I think that would be the the dream scenario I suppose I don't have an issue with us having to when I say live. I meant if someone wanted to access it, they could go and access it. So I don't and and that might not mean everyone, but it might mean one or two people or three people. So if it needs someone to almost do. 0:40:34.710 --> 0:41:4.790 Barrington, Kyle Similar to current, personally, what it's not. You know what you might aim to be in the future? I think that's OK. If someone can go and login and run a report on variances for today. For me, that's OK. I don't think it has to interconnect to our our SAP system currently would be my comment as long as we can get access to the data and see it within a reasonable period of time, an hour, 2 hours whatever, I don't know. 0:41:4.830 --> 0:41:7.470 Barrington, Kyle That's what I mean by life, I suppose. Just to get clarity on that. 0:41:8.70 --> 0:41:13.390 Barrington, Kyle And then my other comment would be Henry, when you say we would own the systems. 0:41:14.810 --> 0:41:17.810 Barrington, Kyle What we wouldn't own Oracle, though, if. 0:41:18.960 --> 0:41:19.40 Ohikhuai, Henry Mm. 0:41:19.390 --> 0:41:22.190 Barrington, Kyle What do you mean by own and just to be clear? 0:41:31.850 --> 0:41:32.370 Barrington, Kyle Sorry. 0:41:20.100 --> 0:41:42.580 Ohikhuai, Henry No, sorry. Just to just to clarify what I just to be clear what I mean, I have a laptop, a machine that I use on my machine. Now I can I cannot access Oracle, so if I need to access Oracle there is another desktop in my office. I have to log into that system. I have NHIPL identity. 0:41:43.900 --> 0:41:51.660 Ohikhuai, Henry E-mail Oracle password everything at HIPAI have. So if I want to do anything on Oracle, I log into that separate machine. 0:41:52.300 --> 0:41:54.420 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. OK and and again. 0:41:53.710 --> 0:41:54.750 Ohikhuai, Henry Yeah, and that's what I need. 0:41:54.210 --> 0:42:7.810 Glyn-Jones, Hugh And Henry. Henry, what are your access rights on that? Are you? It's read only and you can print reports and access data. Or you can you have the same rights as other users. You can make changes to prices and so forth. 0:42:7.490 --> 0:42:15.370 Ohikhuai, Henry No, no, no, no, no, I can't make changes to prices. You'll have a control on some of these things. Yes, yes. 0:42:16.900 --> 0:42:17.780 Vinha, Fernando Now. 0:42:10.300 --> 0:42:17.820 Glyn-Jones, Hugh OK, I just needed to be sure of that because yeah, they weren't like that. If we're not getting access to their system and I. 0:42:37.70 --> 0:42:37.550 Glyn-Jones, Hugh OK. 0:42:45.920 --> 0:42:48.720 Glyn-Jones, Hugh Yeah. So it's not full control, it's just access. 0:42:19.670 --> 0:42:48.950 Vinha, Fernando People, people in the factory guy may have some work station in in some critical areas like back in line for the people can import online what they have to lose. So the guy that they want to do it, they have access just for that they cannot access any others model just this is this is screen they go there and they if they will try to go to the crunch control model or to change the price they cannot do that because change price who has to have access. 0:42:49.740 --> 0:42:50.60 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. 0:42:49.270 --> 0:42:51.750 Vinha, Fernando Just financial team, even me cannot do that. 0:42:52.300 --> 0:43:16.260 Vinha, Fernando I think it is a normal processing. I think you have to to assess the system if you are in your factory. I think from even in Brazil from home I could not assess. I think I have to log on in the factory. I don't know how I'm gonna do it in the future. I think this one can help us and suggest that what could be done OK. Because for us our job in the factory just. 0:43:17.860 --> 0:43:22.780 Vinha, Fernando Issue work order make doing that flash your importing all these things so you. 0:43:23.750 --> 0:43:33.910 Vinha, Fernando It it just and I'll send off


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In a discussion involving Henry Ohikhuai, Kyle Barrington, and others, the topic of system ownership and access was discussed. Henry proposed that all systems used in the factory should be owned by TWINIES, which would allow them to have Oracle on their system. This proposal is still being worked on by Tesan and Denik. Henry also suggested that employees, regardless of their staff status, might have Twinings email. Kyle clarified that by "live" access, he meant that certain individuals should be able to access and run reports on the system within a reasonable timeframe. He also questioned what Henry meant by "owning" the systems. Henry explained that he currently has to use a separate machine to access Oracle, and he proposed a change to this setup. However, he clarified that he does not have full control over the system, such as the ability to change prices. Fernando Vinha added that only certain people, like the financial team, have access to change prices.
