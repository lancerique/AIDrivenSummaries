Write a concise summary of the following:


that Twinings. 1:41:55.360 --> 1:42:26.600 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Doesn't have a quality team that I've is managed directly by Twinings. The quality team we have are Eligio employees who manage this data on behalf of 20S. While we have a 20S representative in terms of areas, the patient manager who supervise over the operation, yes, we have the control agreement where we say nothing can be done to any of these. This is our specification that there to it, but looking at where we're moving to where. 1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:47.640 Osusuluwa, Ejiro We'll be doing full localization. The bit around recipe and all of that mixture. I think the great area is, would we still want to maintain what we're doing, leaving that Allegiant to manage or we're taking that out and we're having 20s employee twinnings tools management managing that. I think that's the question I would probably be looking at. 1:43:1.640 --> 1:43:2.520 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes, correct. 1:43:4.630 --> 1:43:5.630 Ohikhuai, Henry That's correct. 1:42:48.530 --> 1:43:6.490 Vinha, Fernando But but in my view I think today and he is trying over, he has managed this. I think the guy from college control had bought to Wayne. You know I think so. He cannot do anything without paying dorse of course it is all red. But if in the future. 1:43:7.650 --> 1:43:37.810 Vinha, Fernando We want to keep the cost control manage in our payroll times of payroll. OK, you can do that, but it's something that you would define, but all these others is stuff from web can be as we have today because at the end of the day we want to manage this back to BA here and me they cannot do anything without you. Just use Fmsl to pay this guy. OK. To be honest, they have our culture, our safety instructions, everything is twins, OK, they run. 1:43:38.450 --> 1:44:6.610 Vinha, Fernando Something that was done just 2012 to be sure we run it, follow our culture, not fmcl culture is the reason that everyone has to import Duane and he's a guy that goes to like it in the two weeks times you have supply chain meet UK and he goes there, bring the share. Everything's treated exactly as our our operation, even the employees there is paid by fmcl. 1:44:7.50 --> 1:44:17.210 Vinha, Fernando OK, they follow HSC guidance, not FMS LHS guidance. They follow hours. OK it is. 1:44:17.630 --> 1:44:23.390 Kolachalam, Madhu And Fernanda, how do you control that? Any changes that are happening? 1:44:24.830 --> 1:44:40.350 Kolachalam, Madhu In in the specs or basically elixir in the Oracle system today they bomb or anything. They don't make any changes, which is in contradiction to the product spec. How do you? There is no control, right? It's because they could. 1:44:41.940 --> 1:44:51.940 Vinha, Fernando I think they can. I believe they cannot change it today without I think any should have some control because AY is in the factor, he knows it. 1:44:50.410 --> 1:45:21.170 Ohikhuai, Henry No. What's what's happened? Yeah. What's happened for any? Because I don't have access to make any change in the Oracle. Every change that needed to be done is sent to me. I sign, we all sign and agree. So this change is sent to DACA. Daca, who joined us said since I know, DACA. So who effects the change on Oracle? So it's after this signed hardcopy is signed and the change can be affected in Oracle. 1:45:22.290 --> 1:45:23.370 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. OK. 1:45:35.50 --> 1:45:36.450 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. My, my. 1:45:36.250 --> 1:45:36.610 Kolachalam, Madhu Got. 1:45:23.50 --> 1:45:51.890 Vinha, Fernando Because at the end of the day, you know when you wish the production work. The recipes there you can see if they change. I think yes. You have a documentation too. They they cannot change it without everyone sign up. OK. Yeah, of course. Because it is. It is leak is straight to the productor. How can I say if you change recipe automatically you are changing label you are changing label declaration. You have to be sure you are the compliance. So you have to assure on that. OK it's not. 1:45:52.230 --> 1:46:13.270 Vinha, Fernando It is the reason that even though you change 11 raw material, OK, so I have everyone has to agree on from now on when you will see it or if you will do some usage in the in the recipe everyone has to endorse it because it has a lot of implication, OK, product is profile, you are everything OK. 1:46:14.110 --> 1:46:15.950 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. Kyle, you're saying something? 1:46:14.650 --> 1:46:29.570 Barrington, Kyle I'm sorry. Can I just ask a question? Yeah. 'cause. When you say, what do they actually have, then? So 'cause, obviously we import bulk. So do they have all the breakdown of that bulk and do they manage all of that recipe as well currently? 1:46:34.570 --> 1:47:4.250 Vinha, Fernando And then, because the guy from college control, they have the the recipe, they have access to our recipe and in the future they wanna have access to our recipe as well as our processed detail that is more sensitive


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the management of data and operations by Twinings and Eligio employees. The team is considering whether to continue with the current arrangement or to have Twinings employees manage the operations. Fernando Vinha suggests that the cost control could be managed in-house in the future. He also emphasizes that any changes to the product specifications in the Oracle system must be approved and signed off by all parties. The team also discusses the implications of changing a recipe, which could affect the product label and compliance. The question of who has access to the recipe and process details is also raised.
