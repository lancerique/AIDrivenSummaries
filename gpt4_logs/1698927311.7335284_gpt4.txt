What are the triggers for the replenishment if they are not, which also should factor in that the goods might be coming from the other continent into that. 0:34:39.480 --> 0:34:43.320 Pankaj Gadekar So is it what you think is what you looking for? 0:34:43.390 --> 0:34:45.200 Pankaj Gadekar I mean, I understand the business objective. 0:34:45.210 --> 0:34:48.200 Pankaj Gadekar I would just trying to convert this from a system perspective. 0:34:50.210 --> 0:35:5.960 Ricciardi Luca But I I think in the sense that if we're able to find something that is external but that talks talks to SAP without I mean of course creating bridges between the information that we gather from the system and the information and then we feedback in the into the system. 0:35:6.150 --> 0:35:12.0 Ricciardi Luca So the the ability to write things back in SAP because SAP will continue to be our ERP system. 0:35:12.540 --> 0:35:12.760 Dempsey Tim Yeah. 0:35:24.870 --> 0:35:27.560 Dempsey Tim Believe it needs to be a dynamic interface. 0:35:12.10 --> 0:35:27.710 Ricciardi Luca So it means that from a planning point of view, I think we need to extract data when we where we need and and put back data in I when we decide what what is the the scenario we want to go for so that that's what I think we are looking for correct. 0:35:27.670 --> 0:35:36.640 Dempsey Tim Yeah, a dynamic interface from, you know, whatever manipulation that we do, cleansing or crunching of the data externally. 0:35:36.650 --> 0:35:43.960 Dempsey Tim Once that proposal is understood, it should then feedback into SAP that then feeds the standard processes. 0:35:46.810 --> 0:35:46.950 Ricciardi Luca Yeah. 0:35:44.60 --> 0:35:54.670 Dempsey Tim So you know, this is not revolutionary in terms of we at the moment we have reorder points and safety stock that can trigger a purchase requisition. 0:35:57.200 --> 0:35:57.480 Pankaj Gadekar Yes. 0:35:54.780 --> 0:36:3.270 Dempsey Tim That's recommended to the production site because we create a link, a special procurement link between the receiving warehouse and the production site. 0:36:3.340 --> 0:36:21.770 Dempsey Tim So at the moment we have a very basic system that relies either on a manual release of a purchase requisition that then gets converted to a purchase order with an associated goods issue date and then a lead time and that can be that can be automated and people can look at. 0:36:22.30 --> 0:36:31.780 Dempsey Tim You know, we can measure days of inventory and we we could also see very external tool the goods in transit. 0:36:31.790 --> 0:36:37.300 Dempsey Tim So what we're looking to do here is, you know we we know that SAP has a lot of transactional information. 0:36:37.390 --> 0:36:44.860 Dempsey Tim You know, we can look at the order book, we can we can, you know, somehow link in a forecast to this and net it off with some rules. 0:36:45.190 --> 0:36:47.580 Dempsey Tim We can look at production plans that are released. 0:36:47.810 --> 0:36:49.200 Dempsey Tim We can look at stop levels. 0:36:49.210 --> 0:36:50.450 Dempsey Tim We look at stocking transit. 0:36:50.990 --> 0:36:54.950 Dempsey Tim We can look at deliveries created, but a lot of this is done. 0:36:56.250 --> 0:37:9.140 Dempsey Tim Transactionally within SAP, and it's not always joined together talking to you know the end to end is not LinkedIn the sense that if you make a change here dynamically, you wouldn't necessarily see a change in the action here. 0:37:9.210 --> 0:37:17.140 Dempsey Tim It would have to then flow through a kind of someone would have to do a report, look at the impacts and say ohh they they pushed the button here. 0:37:17.210 --> 0:37:30.290 Dempsey Tim Now I need to do something pull a lever here so it's it's more of a data and making sure the data is reliable is very well and and presented into the dashboard. 0:37:30.580 --> 0:37:32.470 Dempsey Tim So the user interface is important. 0:37:32.480 --> 0:37:58.290 Dempsey Tim So could we manage a global company with a few, a few people who are very well trained and and a customized to the the dashboard, the control tower, whatever it might be, so that you know a lot of people will say we can reduce your inventory by 30%, we can, you know increase stock turns, we can improve fulfilment rates, yeah, all of that is great. 0:38:8.980 --> 0:38:9.160 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:37:59.220 --> 0:38:14.100 Dempsey Tim We need to, we need to understand how we could apply that potentially to italmatch so that we are running the operation very efficiently and understanding the risk and we can move more to scenario planning. 0:38:24.920 --> 0:38:25.410 Ricciardi Luca Exactly. 0:38:26.930 --> 0:38:27.370 Ricciardi Luca Excellent. 0:38:14.150 --> 0:38:46.430 Dempsey Tim And you know, if the sales guys want to be opportunistic and say we wanna go and buy some business by reducing the price of this product, how would that look, you know would that translate into production warehouse stock, number of


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the need for a dynamic interface that can interact with the SAP system for efficient inventory management. The current system relies on manual release of purchase requisitions, which can be automated. The goal is to extract and input data as needed for planning, and to ensure that changes in one area dynamically reflect in other areas. The team also discusses the potential benefits of a well-designed dashboard or control tower, which could help manage a global company efficiently, reduce inventory, increase stock turns, and improve fulfillment rates. The ultimate aim is to move towards scenario planning and understand the impacts of business decisions on production, warehouse stock, and other areas.
