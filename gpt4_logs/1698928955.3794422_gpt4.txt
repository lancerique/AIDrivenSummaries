Yeah. 0:48:10.880 --> 0:48:22.310 Dempsey Tim Yes, total product, yeah, product range management is a challenge, let's say, OK, the the company that we are is very sales focused. 0:48:22.440 --> 0:48:28.450 Dempsey Tim It is to make sure we sell every kilo and we're sort and it's how much you've been very successful at that. 0:48:28.900 --> 0:48:39.40 Dempsey Tim We're moving to a phase now where we want to be a bit more and the structured with processes and put data. 0:48:39.90 --> 0:48:39.440 Dempsey Tim OK. 0:48:39.450 --> 0:48:43.100 Dempsey Tim So we're moving away away from that, but it it has always been. 0:48:43.530 --> 0:48:45.100 Dempsey Tim Every cell counts, you know? 0:48:45.110 --> 0:48:45.440 Dempsey Tim So. 0:48:45.500 --> 0:48:53.830 Dempsey Tim So that led to the mentality of, well, if we need to service every order every time with with low accuracy on the forecast and we need lots of stock. 0:48:54.230 --> 0:49:2.560 Dempsey Tim So as we expand, the danger is that you just put more and more stock in different warehouses and you know so. 0:49:2.570 --> 0:49:9.330 Dempsey Tim So we're trying to pull the inventory we're trying to, you know, rationalize the footprint in, in the US best warehouses. 0:49:9.610 --> 0:49:11.250 Dempsey Tim Where's the center of you know? 0:49:13.410 --> 0:49:15.940 Dempsey Tim Where's the best place to have a warehouse? 0:49:15.990 --> 0:49:17.660 Dempsey Tim Can we reduce a couple of warehouses? 0:49:17.670 --> 0:49:26.520 Dempsey Tim You know, you might have a slightly longer lead time for some customers, but you know you can pull the inventory, you've got better accuracy out of one place and three places. 0:49:26.790 --> 0:49:27.270 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah, yeah. 0:49:26.650 --> 0:49:28.940 Dempsey Tim So yeah, yeah, this is. 0:49:30.460 --> 0:49:30.740 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:49:47.560 --> 0:49:47.700 Ricciardi Luca Yeah. 0:49:28.950 --> 0:49:50.550


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Pankaj Gadekar shared his experience with Twinings, a 300-year-old company, where he improved forecast accuracy by 15% and identified unnecessary promotions. He then asked about the availability and duration of historical data. Ricciardi Luca responded that due to several acquisitions, the data varies, with some data dating back to 2013 and others only a year old, averaging to about two years. Pankaj also inquired about changes in their product range, to which Dempsey Tim admitted that product range management is a challenge due to their sales-focused approach. The company is now trying to be more structured with processes and data, aiming to reduce inventory and rationalize their warehouse footprint.
