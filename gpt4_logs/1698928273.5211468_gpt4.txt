Write a concise summary of the following:


training solution. We are rolling out. Do we include that in Nigeria, but that's something we can discuss as a as a separate point and at thisan is up talking to media as well on that. 1:56:2.390 --> 1:56:3.30 Vinha, Fernando OK. 1:56:2.255 --> 1:56:7.255 Osusuluwa, Ejiro I think I I think I agree something we need to look at because which? 1:56:7.495 --> 1:56:9.935 Osusuluwa, Ejiro What we intend to achieve in Apollo 2. 1:56:11.655 --> 1:56:16.895 Osusuluwa, Ejiro If if we're looking at full localization, they're more sensitive quality data and information. 1:56:18.355 --> 1:56:31.115 Osusuluwa, Ejiro That would be available would we want that to be managed by Alicia or we want to have full control around that beats. It's very important question. We need to answer. 1:56:32.345 --> 1:56:56.345 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, and and also, you know what, it will also help is what we're saying is in addition to understanding our own recipes, having control on the process, control on quality, there's a whole regulatory and safety aspect which you can integrate with in terms of the process and have it basically this is our product. So we should have control on the process. So I think we should, we should consider that definitely. 1:56:58.315 --> 1:57:0.955 Thiagarajah, Thisan Would there be an integration? Sorry call. 1:56:58.395 --> 1:57:6.435 Barrington, Kyle Agreed, your face said, Oh no, I was just gonna say sorry. I agree with what you both just support. Jiro and Madhu have just said. 1:57:8.415 --> 1:57:8.895 Kolachalam, Madhu Taking. 1:57:8.315 --> 1:57:12.995 Thiagarajah, Thisan I was just gonna ask Madhu, do you think there'll be an integration necessary or could we manage this as? 1:57:14.765 --> 1:57:15.845 Kolachalam, Madhu See. See you in the night. 1:57:14.695 --> 1:57:17.495 Thiagarajah, Thisan Because I haven't to that stage of my understanding of how spec works. 1:57:17.835 --> 1:57:47.155 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. So so basically, look, ideally the spec PDM sends data to K2, which is a workflow platform and and then in that K2 platform today, they enter the procurement data standard costing and different people enter different attributes in that. And then the data gets pushed to SAP. In this case, it is Oracle Alexa, right? I don't know if you'll be able to create an end to end integration all the way from spec PDM to K2 into Oracle. 1:57:47.995 --> 1:58:17.275 Kolachalam, Madhu But but we need to define a process if we don't have an integration, how do we control that? But if we can create an integration piece on in time, whether phase one or phase two, what that helps is we can block that any change of build of materials in lxs system and the changes only happen from us and when we push that change into production so but but that process it may not happen in phase one because we need to we have to have some manual controls if for October. 1:58:18.195 --> 1:58:18.835 Kolachalam, Madhu 24 client. 1:58:20.495 --> 1:58:21.55 Thiagarajah, Thisan Thank you. 1:58:21.75 --> 1:58:37.795 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. Actually, look, I think this has been a great conversation when we have lot more questions. As I said, I think satisf unless if we have others have more inputs questions, I'm sure we'll have a few more questions I but but I'll, I'll send the notes what I've captured and. 1:58:39.675 --> 1:58:50.275 Kolachalam, Madhu Nudrad or if you have any any good notes please send it to me and and we'll consolidate that to give it a little bit of questions. And what are the key decision points from a systems we need to make and take it forward. 1:58:51.865 --> 1:59:19.905 Kolachalam, Madhu But I think, yeah, I think this has been great in for to baseline the areas we need to think about and basically we touched upon product management manufacturing from 2 dimensions manufacturing from a cost tags inventory and the material management standpoint and manufacturing from MES standpoint, which may be a phase two priority and then order to cash process in terms of distribution entities, I think we may not be changing the model. 1:59:20.305 --> 1:59:34.25 Kolachalam, Madhu But the with the volume increase the opportunity to simplify and drive efficiencies there. We just need to think about it this this on the already identified some of them. So we'll consolidate all these notes and we can have a discussion these are and publish it. 1:59:35.605 --> 1:59:37.885 Kolachalam, Madhu Anything else? Go ahead. You have your hand up. 1:59:38.695 --> 2:0:10.735 Thiagarajah, Thisan The only thing I think is worth discussing Madhu, is the procurement process of raw materials, because one of the things I've understood is that that's done very manually using emails and then once pricing and vendors have been selected, it's again an e-mail that gets sent over to someone to key in manually in Oracle system when they're placing their orders. So if they if they want to recognise a latest price, it's it's up to them to remember there's a latest


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team is discussing the rollout of a new training solution, with potential inclusion in Nigeria. They are considering full localization and the management of sensitive quality data and information. They discuss the importance of having control over the process and quality, as well as integrating regulatory and safety aspects. The conversation also covers the potential need for integration between different platforms (spec PDM, K2, and Oracle Alexa) for data management. They discuss the need for a process to control data if integration is not possible. The procurement process of raw materials, currently done manually via emails, is also identified as an area for improvement.
