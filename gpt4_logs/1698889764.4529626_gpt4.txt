Kolachalam, Madhu
And we started working and we'll continue to do that. This one has mobilised that on the application space is where me and Tyson were discussing several things. I just want to understand a little bit more on your perspective on any, any key concern area specifically to you or or I can just go through and start asking some questions in terms of the big picture. So what I'm trying to do is not not just about Jan 2025 readiness of what I'm trying to look at is like what would a three-year road map look like from an app or a digital strategy for Nigeria?
0:0:32.0 --> 0:0:33.160
Kolachalam, Madhu
Or even a four years and then.
0:0:34.520 --> 0:0:56.520
Kolachalam, Madhu
Work towards that and then say OK year one is this year 2 is this and we resource it and and also drive that is that that was what I was pushing these on for look. But Jan is important. Let's also think what happens post Jan and all so that was the context in which I wanted to spend some time and work with you. So does that make sense or do you have a different approach or any thoughts?

Vinha, Fernando
It's OK.
0:1:0.490 --> 0:1:11.290
Barrington, Kyle
Just some my comment, I think I think a a road map is useful. However, my view is that the priority is on Jan Go live.
0:1:12.770 --> 0:1:30.450
Barrington, Kyle
I think if we can't produce in Jan and the systems can't tell us what's happening and we can't track inventory and stuff, we're spending £27 million for for, I suppose nothing. So A3 year mode map is is great. I see that as a.
0:1:32.690 --> 0:1:42.770
Barrington, Kyle
An add on rather than the the main focus personally, but it's not my not my call that would only be sort of my my viewpoint.
0:1:44.350 --> 0:1:47.70
Kolachalam, Madhu
That's fair game. Now what about others?
0:1:46.210 --> 0:1:56.90
Glyn-Jones, Hugh
Yeah, maybe if I can just add in there as as well. Margie. Sorry, I'm Hugh. We haven't met. And I also hadn't met Nuder yet and and Prem and Jerem, so hi everyone.
0:1:57.610 --> 0:2:9.170
Glyn-Jones, Hugh
Just to agree with what Kyle has said, I mean this has to obviously fit into the overall biz tech aspect of the of the project and I think.
0:2:10.730 --> 0:2:18.650
Glyn-Jones, Hugh
While I agree that the focus is on the production date, we don't want to be developing and putting something in with that as the end date.
0:2:19.250 --> 0:2:48.130


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Madhu Kolachalam initiated a discussion about creating a three-year roadmap for an app or digital strategy for Nigeria, emphasizing the importance of planning beyond January 2025. Fernando Vinha agreed with the approach. However, Kyle Barrington stressed the priority should be on the January go-live date, viewing the three-year roadmap as an add-on rather than the main focus. Hugh Glyn-Jones agreed with Kyle, stating that while the production date is important, they should avoid developing something with that as the end date.
