0:27:39.50 Dempsey Tim Umm. 0:27:47.210 --> 0:27:47.460 Dempsey Tim Moving. 0:27:54.330 --> 0:27:54.530 Dempsey Tim Umm. 0:27:56.380 --> 0:27:56.780 Pankaj Gadekar Got it. 0:27:56.700 --> 0:27:57.40 Dempsey Tim And it. 0:27:39.0 --> 0:27:58.570 Ricciardi Luca So basically to have an integrated plan in that can allow us to pass through from sales forecasting to to the manufacturing side without any at a huge number of steps in, in, in, in in between which of course are sometimes not under percent connected. 0:27:58.580 --> 0:27:59.100 Ricciardi Luca You know what I mean? 0:27:59.360 --> 0:27:59.930 Dempsey Tim And it would. 0:28:0.20 --> 0:28:9.60 Dempsey Tim It would also be very be we're on a journey to get and are money factoring sites to use MRP. 0:28:9.150 --> 0:28:9.480 Dempsey Tim OK. 0:28:9.490 --> 0:28:35.330 Dempsey Tim So we're going through a roll out of defining the stocks or categorizing make to stock make to order looking at lead times, looking at unique raw material lead times and and when when we get this configured correctly, where we're looking to to basically segment the business in terms of which flows are stable and predictable. 0:28:35.510 --> 0:28:43.400 Dempsey Tim So some of our flows between regions of the world are predictable in the sense that the product range is stable. 0:28:43.470 --> 0:28:47.220 Dempsey Tim OK, so we have, let's say, tolling in a certain region. 0:28:47.310 --> 0:28:56.240 Dempsey Tim We send raw materials to this region for tolling and the challenge is just, you know, do we send this amount of stock this month or this amount? 0:28:56.330 --> 0:28:56.960 Dempsey Tim It's not. 0:28:57.270 --> 0:28:57.720 Dempsey Tim Yes. 0:28:57.730 --> 0:29:10.820 Dempsey Tim No, it's a question of how much do we send and it's defining the parameters the you know, the tram lines between between which men and Max should we be working and really take the complexity out of what we're doing. 0:29:11.700 --> 0:29:16.230 Dempsey Tim To have something that the user the planner can have by acception. 0:29:17.210 --> 0:29:17.380 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:29:16.240 --> 0:29:17.550 Dempsey Tim So what are? 0:29:18.60 --> 0:29:18.430 Dempsey Tim Yeah. 0:29:18.440 --> 0:29:21.170 Dempsey Tim What are the you know, in a control tower type environment? 0:29:21.180 --> 0:29:22.730 Dempsey Tim What are the hot topics of today? 0:29:23.270 --> 0:29:23.430 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:29:22.860 --> 0:29:26.510 Dempsey Tim Where is the risk of stock out or the risk of short supply? 0:29:26.780 --> 0:29:28.930 Dempsey Tim And we don't need to look at everything. 0:29:28.940 --> 0:29:35.490 Dempsey Tim So we do want to automate replenishment via planning parameters within the system. 0:29:35.500 --> 0:29:39.700 Dempsey Tim Obviously triggering through our MRP and we need to be able to. 0:29:40.970 --> 0:29:43.40 Dempsey Tim And be modeling scenarios. 0:29:43.50 --> 0:30:5.620 Dempsey Tim If the business is to grow, how does that look both from a product supply and and also can we somehow explode this through Bill of materials and look at a purchasing plan so there's, you know, you think of the big data we're looking to manage by exception, stabilize the replenishment so that we have you call it fill rate, we call it OTIF for our customers. 0:30:5.690 --> 0:30:10.0 Dempsey Tim So high OTIF, you know you you imagine you speak to any company. 0:30:10.50 --> 0:30:10.760 Dempsey Tim What do you want? 0:30:10.820 --> 0:30:11.910 Dempsey Tim We want hail tiff. 0:30:12.410 --> 0:30:23.40 Dempsey Tim We want optimized working capital, optimize inventory and we want technology enablers so that this becomes scalable if we have new acquisitions. 0:30:23.280 --> 0:30:30.670 Dempsey Tim And it also does not mean that as we grow the business, we have to incrementally add headcount to do this. 0:30:31.550 --> 0:30:33.530 Pankaj Gadekar But it no no I I. 0:30:30.760 --> 0:30:36.560 Dempsey Tim So this is yeah, this is the kind of the common concept that we have in the in the business world, yeah. 0:30:37.720 --> 0:30:38.170 Ricciardi Luca Yeah. 0:30:37.510 --> 0:30:38.830 Pankaj Gadekar Understood. Uh. 0:30:38.690 --> 0:30:39.270 Ajay Aggarwal Absolutely. 0:30:38.220 --> 0:30:40.470 Ricciardi Luca I I also had one thing, if I can. 0:30:41.60 --> 0:30:41.290 Pankaj Gadekar Sure. 0:30:40.600 --> 0:30:49.610 Ricciardi Luca Uh, the the the bit that we are currently missing is a little bit of a simulation in the sense that at the moment we are not able to simulate, for example, the impact of on. 0:30:50.100 --> 0:31:3.470 Ricciardi Luca I mean, let's assume a raw material increases is cost dramatically and then we would like to understand which is gonna be the impact on our working capital and potentially make some adjustments to our stocking strategy to reduce and keep the the value. 0:31:3.660 --> 0:31:8.870 Ricciardi Luca I mean fixed that we keep in our warehouses, that's not something that we are able to do at the moment.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the need for an integrated plan to streamline the process from sales forecasting to manufacturing. The team is working on defining stocks, categorizing make-to-stock and make-to-order, and examining lead times. They aim to segment the business based on stable and predictable flows, and automate replenishment via planning parameters within the system. The goal is to optimize working capital, inventory, and use technology enablers for scalability. They also discuss the need for a system to simulate the impact of changes in raw material costs on working capital and adjust stocking strategies accordingly.
