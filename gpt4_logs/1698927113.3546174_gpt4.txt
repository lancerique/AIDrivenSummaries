is training sole team who is buying the finish to goods and then selling it to Fmcl, which is kind of a entity. What does fmcl use for this is so my understanding is elixir manufacturing will use Oracle is what I understand from the one of the slides, Twinings. 0:18:12.340 --> 0:18:12.700 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yeah. 0:18:17.980 --> 0:18:18.740 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Oracle. 0:18:9.240 --> 0:18:19.480 Kolachalam, Madhu Legal entity is using sapb one and we'll discuss the risks and challenges and then what is fmcl going to use to what is their erpcs. 0:18:19.910 --> 0:18:20.550 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Oracle. 0:18:21.750 --> 0:18:21.950 Vinha, Fernando Hello. 0:18:21.250 --> 0:18:37.250 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. And and and and Israel is the is the system when you say Oracle, Oracle is a technology, right? But is the actual system or application is it the same common application both elixir and Fmcl users are the two separate applications? 0:18:37.500 --> 0:18:38.940 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Same same application. 0:18:41.530 --> 0:18:53.290 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. OK. So and and and is Fmcl registered as a separate legal entity in Nigeria or it's just a distribution entity within a one legal entity which is a separately different? 0:18:54.250 --> 0:18:57.130 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So it's registered as a separate legal entity. 0:19:9.70 --> 0:19:10.150 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yeah. Yes. 0:19:19.420 --> 0:19:19.900 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes. 0:18:58.110 --> 0:19:22.30 Kolachalam, Madhu OK, so basically in the Oracle system, they're set up two legal entities, elixir and fmcl. Elixir is will be set up as a supplier in our in our B1 platform currently and and we buy them from them and then fmcl will be set up as a customer. We sell to them and and look at that and and Fernando is is that the right understanding. 0:19:23.890 --> 0:19:25.650 Vinha, Fernando I think so, yes, I yes. 0:19:26.310 --> 0:19:26.830 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 0:19:26.0 --> 0:19:35.400 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK, so so so that the right understanding. I think for me the two questions that are top of my mind is one with the current. 0:19:36.840 --> 0:19:39.200 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Model, which is what we just explained. 0:19:40.920 --> 0:19:42.440 Osusuluwa, Ejiro When we moved to. 0:19:44.40 --> 0:19:45.760 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Our own facility. 0:19:48.420 --> 0:19:54.620 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Do we? Do we still want to have control and access to? 0:19:56.740 --> 0:20:6.460 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Those information directly from Oracle we go. Currently we don't, they have to spool and share with us, that's one. 0:20:7.900 --> 0:20:13.900 Osusuluwa, Ejiro The custom model we talk about currently in Oracle, you can't get that exact. 0:20:15.260 --> 0:20:19.580 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Finish output. So what we do is we'll spool the report from. 0:20:33.930 --> 0:20:34.90 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 0:20:21.620 --> 0:20:37.820 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Oracle, we have a template which we use to be able to determine the standard costs and the true up in society through up cost because the current model, what we do is that we are agreeing standard price. 0:20:55.40 --> 0:20:55.600 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, yeah. 0:20:38.690 --> 0:21:1.130 Osusuluwa, Ejiro I'm arrive at that standard price. We are zoomed in on our budget numbers. What they need to produce based on the output from the S and OP meetings and calculate the standard price which elixir permit me to use the word nhpi, because that's what the name is now NH PL-1 is attachable so but let me just stick to Eliza. We are aligned with Alicia and. 0:21:2.530 --> 0:21:17.650 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Antoine is agree on that standard price and once that is signed off, that standard price per case is what we load in SAP. Just to say this is the price per case. So every product that is produced from Elixir. 0:21:26.990 --> 0:21:27.590 Vinha, Fernando Oh, OK. 0:21:18.400 --> 0:21:49.920 Osusuluwa, Ejiro When is invoice to us, where do you have that standard price in the system? But at the end of the quarter, every three months, we need to do what is called a true up exercise, where Twinings will have to go to their leisure plant to verify packaging material that you've bought. What is the actual price you've bought it? Your labour cost? What is the actual cost? Your utility? What is the actual cost? Show me evidence of supporting document to show that this is what you've actually paid. 0:21:50.230 --> 0:21:54.710 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And other verifications are done once other site is completed. 0:21:56.150 --> 0:22:5.230 Osusuluwa, Ejiro The throw up is now done to now say this is the actual cost that has been incured in producing this product. 0:22:5.890 --> 0:22:6.50 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 0:22:14.550 --> 0:22:14.950 Kolachalam, Madhu So. 0:22:6.670 --> 0:22:22.590 Osusuluwa, Ejiro The difference between the standard and the actual could result to a debit or a credit note that will be raised and be posted at both end. Now. That is because that is because we don't have full control and all of that. So how will


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team is discussing the use of Oracle by Elixir Manufacturing and FMCL, both of which are set up as separate legal entities in Nigeria. Elixir is set up as a supplier and FMCL as a customer in the Oracle system. The team discusses the challenges of not having direct access to information from Oracle and the need for a custom model. They also discuss the process of determining standard costs and the need for a "true up" exercise every three months to verify actual costs. The difference between standard and actual costs could result in a debit or credit note.
