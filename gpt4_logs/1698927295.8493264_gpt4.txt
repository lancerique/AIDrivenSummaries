Write a concise summary of the following:


inside of the working process. OK. But it is a lot of detail. We too can do it late to to define it but it's more or less the way it won't work. OK. 0:52:44.290 --> 0:52:51.850 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, and and we can map that Fernando as part of detail mapping. So in in this one, I think just to also just add a conceptual level. 0:52:53.370 --> 0:53:30.690 Kolachalam, Madhu The back flash there are two dimensions, the physical material flow from raw materials to the production line to actual consumption on a on a manufacturing show floor at a specific operation entity. And so that's one physical material flow. Then the system material flow and then how do we ultimately reconcile? And I don't think it will ever be perfect that your system and physical will always be the same level of precision and but we need to have a reconciliation at a concept level and what level of visibility we need at that is a requirement definition in each business unit level. We need to define and then based on that. 0:53:31.690 --> 0:53:37.530 Kolachalam, Madhu For example, just just to give on any manufacturing, let us say in a discrete manufacturing world, we are issuing screws. 0:53:38.180 --> 0:53:58.780 Kolachalam, Madhu They don't care really about tracking how many screws are there that may be small component. If you're manufacturing $1,000,000 equipment right? So so how we treat that would be very different. The path natures and all. But but we can map that out to working with them. So there is a whole concept of physical systematic and how all that ties out and what we want to generate out of that. 0:53:59.650 --> 0:54:32.170 Vinha, Fernando Yes, because also you just because the the key, but for all my children back my child, all these to allocate to the product boss is is quite simple. But you have to see how wanna locate the utility cost. OK, so you have to break our factory tree productive cost centre. They drive gonna be 1 cost centre dry mix. You'll be another cost centre and pecking will be another cost centre. So because I I had it to to to be sure why you're going to have to allocate. 0:54:32.370 --> 0:55:7.170 Vinha, Fernando My steam cost, my steam cost must be allocating about product. OK is where I I spend esteem. I don't spend Stein the packing line. OK, there is just electricity. So it is something that you have to do. So all you have to set up our product centre. How much you want to have and the cost by cost cent and how many hours each cost cent. Do you want to work per per day or per month? I have to see this. The, the the system about how the how Oracle the Treaty how is the screening to input this data but for me. 0:55:11.310 --> 0:55:11.630 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. 0:55:7.970 --> 0:55:16.730 Vinha, Fernando It's like I think it is quite standard as I you break this cost set and so I see this product for me produce 1K of. 0:55:18.190 --> 0:55:30.190 Vinha, Fernando How about in bulk? I need this usage by the HD usage per kilo OK and so and how many hours I spent to produce 1K. 0:55:43.380 --> 0:55:44.460 Kolachalam, Madhu Sure, sure. 0:55:31.830 --> 0:55:45.270 Vinha, Fernando Of of the bulb product. So everything you have to set up in this system, OK, I have to send to this some how you have it today. OK, how you break it in the day? OK. 0:55:45.900 --> 0:55:51.580 Kolachalam, Madhu Jennifer and and we can and that can figure out in Oracle does lot of it as I think Israel and Henry had their hands up. 0:55:53.230 --> 0:55:59.390 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes, Amanda, just to add to what Fernando said and one of the question you asked. 0:56:9.90 --> 0:56:9.410 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 0:56:1.30 --> 0:56:23.310 Ohikhuai, Henry On a weekly basis or based on our alignment, you have what you called stock count. Stock count is perform on on the show floor maybe on weekly basis or as we may have agreed. So what happened is that when material is issued physically to production on the system, the material is issued. 0:56:23.740 --> 0:56:53.740 Ohikhuai, Henry Now production is being executed over a given period of time. If our agreement is that on weekly basis, we do a stock count as you mean it's Saturday on Saturday morning, 8:00 AM, we do a physical count of the material that is on ground and then we go to the system. We do the system adjustment by posting the count which have been counted. Sometimes you have the count done by production finance warehouse as the case may be. 0:56:53.820 --> 0:56:56.940 Ohikhuai, Henry So we adjust the system and then the wasted. 0:57:22.510 --> 0:57:22.750 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. 0:57:22.860 --> 0:57:39.780 Ohikhuai, Henry It's not that you just run the whole 1-2 months, one month, you are not cancel your material even if as long as the material have been agreed to be to have a value which impacts the product cost, it must be counted periodically. 0:57:40.650 --> 0:57:42.970 Kolachalam, Madhu And and Henry today you do that. 0:57:44.370 --> 0:57:47.330 Kolachalam, Madhu Or basically does


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the working process of a manufacturing unit, focusing on the physical and system material flow from raw materials to the production line. The team discusses the need for reconciliation between the physical and system flow, which may not always be perfectly aligned. They also discuss the importance of tracking components, cost allocation, and the need for periodic stock counts to ensure accuracy. The conversation also touches on the use of Oracle for managing these processes.
