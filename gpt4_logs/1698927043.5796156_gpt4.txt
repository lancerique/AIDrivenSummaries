hmm. Gonna be this, but we have many others than man to look into it, but. 0:4:40.820 --> 0:4:56.420 Vinha, Fernando You have to understand what you have today very clear and you have what you have to do for now to October, to be sure we have. When you start to run our factory in in Jan you could you could use the seasonal OK. 0:4:56.900 --> 0:5:11.380 Vinha, Fernando To to, to, to to reach your production, order to to reach your material plan. Everything OK has to be read. OK. And what has to be done and who you gonna do, OK. 0:5:12.690 --> 0:5:15.370 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. Got it. Fernando, thank you. And and. 0:5:14.860 --> 0:5:16.340 Osusuluwa, Ejiro You just OK. 0:5:17.650 --> 0:5:18.490 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK. Hi my love. 0:5:16.890 --> 0:5:19.970 Kolachalam, Madhu Go ahead, Andy. Go ahead, Ezra. 0:5:20.490 --> 0:5:50.250 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Now just what I just wanted to add, I'm speaking to what Kyle said, but that's a bit of a different angle we in terms of aligning with the business objective and goals. So I think if we, I hope to get a more clear understanding around the business model because that should be closely aligned with the overall business good and objective and it will help us define how the IT infrastructure infrastructure and applications. 0:5:50.850 --> 0:5:58.90 Osusuluwa, Ejiro That we need to support and drive the business strategy. So if there's a cloud alignment to ensure the technology investments are meaningful. 0:5:59.320 --> 0:6:25.600 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And to contribute to the financial success, so if we have that clarity around what is the business model that we are looking at in 2024, is it what we currently have that would also give us an insight into what we need to do as to the road maps towards the target. We're looking at that January 24, are we changing the business model that also can also give us some insight into what are the? 0:6:27.40 --> 0:6:32.720 Osusuluwa, Ejiro ERP application to that we probably will want to go with or we just go with what we have in the system. 0:6:47.320 --> 0:6:47.440 Vinha, Fernando But. 0:6:33.950 --> 0:6:53.30 Kolachalam, Madhu But in each of when you say business model like could you give me an example of I means I again I'm assuming the business model is finalised for Jan 2024 is the details we are working on but are there are there some business model discussions still open that we are discussing currently? 0:6:54.360 --> 0:6:56.360 Barrington, Kyle Maybe I can solve it but. 0:6:53.960 --> 0:6:58.320 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK, So what? What? I mean. OK, OK. Maybe I will just take. OK. I can go ahead. 0:6:59.720 --> 0:7:12.120 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, see and then correct me if I'm wrong in Jerry. But effectively when we set a business model, I says what we're talking about here is our our relationship with Elixir, who are effectively for want of a better phrase, our manufacturing partner. 0:7:13.680 --> 0:7:17.160 Barrington, Kyle So I I can take through that, but it's. But the principles are going to stay. 0:7:18.760 --> 0:7:27.840 Barrington, Kyle Very similar to current, there's going to be some subtle changes because we now own the factory versus previous that Alexia owns the factory. 0:7:29.210 --> 0:7:39.10 Barrington, Kyle But Prince, the principle behind it is going to be the same, which is almost we. They will be responsible for buying product. 0:7:40.410 --> 0:7:53.10 Barrington, Kyle We will effectively purchase it off them for a for a price. They will give us sort of, they will run off a cost plus model and I suppose that's quite important because. 0:7:54.530 --> 0:7:54.690 Barrington, Kyle That. 0:7:57.480 --> 0:8:12.200 Barrington, Kyle Their costs obviously drive our costs. Therefore they're not sort of, you know, efficiencies and stuff isn't they're not incentivized necessarily to drive efficiencies in, in the model set up the way sort of that's managed is by the fact that we would have. 0:8:13.640 --> 0:8:15.120 Barrington, Kyle The plant manager and effectively. 0:8:17.280 --> 0:8:22.160 Barrington, Kyle That's sort of Henry currently obviously in the current operation Fernando is going to be there. 0:8:23.880 --> 0:8:26.600 Barrington, Kyle When we sort of set up the new factory for a year. 0:8:27.0 --> 0:8:28.720 Barrington, Kyle I think is the the understanding. 0:8:30.600 --> 0:9:0.160 Barrington, Kyle And you know, so it's going to be a mixture of effectively we'll have the plant manager plus a couple of other more highly skilled roles that will be employed directly by tonal. Everyone else will be employed by Alexia. So there won't be our employees, but effectively, Fernando and Henry would be responsible for managing them. And, you know, managing the plant and everything that happens within that. So, so that means. 0:9:0.720 --> 0:9:3.320 Barrington, Kyle There's going to be certain things, for example. 0:9:4.680 --> 0:9:14.0 Barrington, Kyle That Fernando and stuff is going to need, which is obviously comes on to
