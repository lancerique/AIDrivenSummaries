Write a concise summary of the following:


distribution? I think that also we need to check. 1:24:50.430 --> 1:24:59.30 Thiagarajah, Thisan Yeah, I think what they were saying from Cameron for libria, they were saying it wasn't fmcr, right? It was managed separately for a distant distribution. I think that's what I captured. 1:25:0.790 --> 1:25:1.670 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes, camero. 1:25:0.720 --> 1:25:1.720 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Find me separately. 1:24:59.710 --> 1:25:1.750 Kolachalam, Madhu No. So that distribution entity. 1:25:2.870 --> 1:25:3.30 Ohikhuai, Henry Yeah. 1:25:3.930 --> 1:25:6.930 Kolachalam, Madhu Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. Henry. How to use them. 1:25:8.90 --> 1:25:11.890 Ohikhuai, Henry No rest of Africa is managed separately. Is FMC is not involved. 1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:16.120 Kolachalam, Madhu So if the even the inventory doesn't go to FMC. 1:25:17.340 --> 1:25:17.780 Barrington, Kyle No. 1:25:18.50 --> 1:25:18.970 Osusuluwa, Ejiro No, it does not. 1:25:20.350 --> 1:25:20.910 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 1:25:17.270 --> 1:25:22.390 Ohikhuai, Henry Not at all. Right from production direct to these customers, wherever they are. 1:25:23.70 --> 1:25:33.950 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, that. That. Yeah. So that's that's a good one these and I think basically the whole export process has to be mapped out separately. It is not same as the fmcl process. So I think that's really the take away. 1:25:34.380 --> 1:25:36.340 Thiagarajah, Thisan Yeah. Yeah. OK. 1:25:38.410 --> 1:25:46.770 Nudrat A Yeah. So, let let me couple of minutes not more than that. So I believe just Henry or. 1:26:1.950 --> 1:26:2.390 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes. 1:25:48.880 --> 1:26:3.600 Nudrat A Whoever is having the understanding, just let me know what do you know my questions, but this especially fmcl I'm I'm getting the understanding of this Alexa I'm I'm not sure whether this spelling is right for this but training is our entity where we delay. 1:26:5.0 --> 1:26:14.160 Nudrat A I I wanted to understand the role of FM, CM FM CF and somehow the relationship. I understood, you know wherever within the. 1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:44.920 Nudrat A Fmcl business is totally working on our metric stock process especially and wherever you are getting the requirement from other countries, it is being handled like special orders or export orders like that you are you are managing. But this fmcl what about business they are doing it for home they are selling it those records those details are you I mean your your team is interested to you know see the analysis what they are doing it or your relationship ends when you are shipping. 1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:49.720 Nudrat A Your fgr finished good to the fmcl your relation ends. 1:26:52.930 --> 1:26:53.370 Nudrat A I don't know. 1:26:52.310 --> 1:26:54.710 Ohikhuai, Henry OK, Angelo. 1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:55.40 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Aaron. Erin, you want to take that? 1:26:55.660 --> 1:26:57.380 Ohikhuai, Henry Angelo, you can't not see me. 1:26:57.730 --> 1:27:10.290 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK, so the relationship doesn't just end after we transfer or invoice them. The relationship goes beyond that we're interested in. 1:27:11.690 --> 1:27:13.730 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Where they sell the product to. 1:27:15.210 --> 1:27:27.930 Osusuluwa, Ejiro The distributors they sell to and what are the stock level distributors have, what's which region they sold to and all of that information currently? 1:27:28.460 --> 1:27:57.780 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Those information we get them from fmcl the data are are made available by FMC to us, so the relationship doesn't just end after we sell. We're interested in seeing how the stock was sold to them in the pipeline. Hiding bit. Is it depleted? Was the road to market because all those information also helps us to understand how sales is going, what we need to do, if there are some bits of trade. 1:27:59.180 --> 1:28:2.180 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Promotions or tactical or tactical tactical discount. We need to give. 1:28:2.870 --> 1:28:16.470 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Also, the number of volume of product that is being sold to the distributor is also important because based on that data, we're able to calculate and determine what the discount. 1:28:17.190 --> 1:28:27.310 Osusuluwa, Ejiro We need to give to fmcl because they we have an arrangement with them in terms of discount that we give to distribute what are. 1:28:42.50 --> 1:28:42.170 Nudrat A Hmm. 1:28:27.350 --> 1:28:45.430 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Wholesaler, retailer or key distributor they sell to and that data where we get from them is able to, we're able to use that to determine what are the discounts that we need to replenish fmca back for. So it doesn't does stop at all selling it goes beyond that. 1:28:46.580 --> 1:29:10.180 Nudrat A OK, so it it seems that for for me. Do you know by considering your industry were vertical, it seems that there's nothing but a secondary sales which you are tracking it for the you know monitoring the inventory, the placement prospects and op perspective. The data is very important and


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team discussed the distribution process for their product. It was clarified that the rest of Africa is managed separately and the inventory does not go to FMC. The export process is different from the FMCL process and needs to be mapped out separately. The team also discussed the role of FMCL and their interest in tracking where the product is sold, the stock levels at distributors, and the regions they are sold in. This data is used to understand sales trends and determine discounts. The relationship with FMCL extends beyond just selling the product.
