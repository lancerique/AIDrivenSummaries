PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


situations where we've had goods return or even product recall at all. The only thing we've had is from the manufacturing where we have wastage. 2:12:49.75 --> 2:12:50.515 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Before it gets to. 2:12:52.275 --> 2:13:0.355 Osusuluwa, Ejiro The distributor internally we make a call on what we need to do, so that comes in as part of our our wastage. The only time we had. 2:13:17.905 --> 2:13:18.105 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 2:13:1.535 --> 2:13:23.695 Osusuluwa, Ejiro A situation like that was there was a product we did I think was the promo pack. There was something that was wrong with the ceiling, the entire products we we had to hold it back by quality and we had to write that off. So we've not act that kind of experience where from the trade off of the distributor we have in returns. 2:13:35.315 --> 2:13:36.355 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So so that's. 2:13:24.425 --> 2:13:38.305 Vinha, Fernando Now it's because sometimes the product they're exporting the market, so you have to send it back to the factory, how you control it, how you just show it, how you make sure it is destroyed properly, do not to apply to expose, OK. 2:13:38.15 --> 2:14:1.775 Osusuluwa, Ejiro But now I'm saying so far, I think we've been very proactive and we've been managing that. We have data and information coming in from fmcl. So recently I know we had three in one which were close to expiring. We have those information around the batches and when they're expiring. So we keep track of that. So when such situation happen, we don't wait till they get expired. So like in the three one. 2:14:3.455 --> 2:14:8.575 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Sku FMC are shared with us. We have such such number of quantity of. 2:14:9.165 --> 2:14:29.125 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Do you want products in trade? Are close to expiring. We had meetings and what we decided to do was to run a trade promotion that would have to accelerate the depletion of those stocks that are sitting in the distributor warehouse. So so far, like I said, we've been managing that very effectively and we've not had that case. 2:14:30.175 --> 2:14:55.855 Vinha, Fernando But then just the issue, just to be sure you call everything and to have some damages, some goods get damaged in the market, you have to replace the cartel. So you need a proper process to send it back to to the factory he placed the carton and send it again to fmcl. So you have to be sure you have in this system and this you can that you can do that OK properly. OK. 2:14:55.525 --> 2:15:18.845 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes, yes, Fernando, the system can do that. But I think it's more of an agreement what we would incorporate in our contract to say who bears the cost. So you can actually bffmc have break this product. You can actually replace that. But you know that in replacing that you need to touch that as either wastage or do you want to build that. 2:15:20.365 --> 2:15:31.565 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Patterns to fmcs. So those are things that need to be clearly spelled out in the agreement so that you know who takes some big responsibility but the system. 2:15:37.105 --> 2:15:37.385 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 2:15:32.115 --> 2:15:38.75 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Definitely will allow you to issue that, but you need to charge it somewhere. How you trade that cost is what I think is more important. 2:15:39.185 --> 2:15:41.25 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. Makes sense. 2:15:40.85 --> 2:15:41.845 Vinha, Fernando OK, I got it. 2:15:44.645 --> 2:16:9.285 Kolachalam, Madhu OK, I I I know this is our first discussion. I'm sure there will be more things coming up as we there, but at least I was this, I I know it was extremely helpful for me to understand where the priorities are at least to recommend something. And then Tisan and the team can decide working with you. But was this helpful for you or I hope this was not a waste of anybody's time. 2:16:14.395 --> 2:16:18.875 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Definitely. For me, I think it's it's quite helpful. There's clarity I think. 2:16:20.395 --> 2:16:23.115 Osusuluwa, Ejiro I'm looking forward to seeing the final outputs in terms of the road map. 2:16:25.35 --> 2:16:39.315 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And I'm trusting you guys will come up with something that would make the entire process not as complicated as the conversation conversation is, and we're able to get that done by it's. Yeah. It's very helpful, very insightful. 2:16:40.935 --> 2:16:41.415 Vinha, Fernando OK. 2:16:41.805 --> 2:16:42.485 Kolachalam, Madhu Thanks Adrian. 2:16:42.695 --> 2:16:44.655 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. Helpful. Helpful for me. 2:16:46.135 --> 2:16:50.815 Barrington, Kyle As always in terms of good to then think about next steps at some point and sort of. 2:16:53.335 --> 2:17:10.15 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, like when do we get into specifics or even more specific when we sort of go into day or so, how did this plan out or how long do you think this needs to take or what point do we need to start talking to, Alexia, how long is it going to take them to implement all those sort of
