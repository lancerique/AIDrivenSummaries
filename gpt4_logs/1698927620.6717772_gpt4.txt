than just recipe. It was the reason that we were discussing the past for the key position side of the fact should be our employee or fmcr employee. If something is still ongoing to be defined. OK. 1:47:12.930 --> 1:47:13.210 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 1:47:6.730 --> 1:47:31.930 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. So if they have access to our recipe now, how there's no reason anyway, that should change in the, you know, that should impact in the future. But anyway, OK, so they've got full detail of our recipe now and it and do they have full detail of all the specifications of ingredients that go into that recipe because my we always seem to go to China to ask those questions. If our in my experience and maybe. 1:47:31.190 --> 1:47:41.790 Vinha, Fernando No. Yeah. But Kyle, you need to to have all this is back in, in the ground, in, in, in the future because if someone. 1:47:40.630 --> 1:48:11.390 Barrington, Kyle So I agree. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. You misunderstood my point. So sorry, just jump in. I completely agree with you have in the future, I'm saying I don't know if we do have it now would be my. That's what I'm. I'm sorry. So I do think this is something different where we don't have the specifications of all our ingredients locally. If someone was asking a question to the Nigerian team, well, well what what exactly? I don't know what grade of cocoa powder making up an unearned. Maybe a bad example. But what grade of glucose or I don't know. 1:48:11.430 --> 1:48:12.550 Barrington, Kyle LME, do you need to use? 1:48:19.700 --> 1:48:20.380 Vinha, Fernando Oh. 1:48:13.300 --> 1:48:20.700 Barrington, Kyle Like I'm I'm not sure that we have that in Nigeria. So that's something that does need to be thought about in the future. 1:48:21.670 --> 1:48:54.590 Vinha, Fernando Yes. OK. Just for your knowledge, I have asked you others already to send the specification and Vito has it in his hand for all raw material used to produce our bulk. We need it because it's not pack one come to this to to come to audit your factory. If they ask they they already spec off Google you have to present it to them they have everything already OK that we have exact the same spec of what all RAM machines China has been using you want to use the same giant. 1:48:58.950 --> 1:49:0.150 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, I I think. 1:48:54.650 --> 1:49:13.890 Vinha, Fernando Because if you're not, you cannot deliver the product. This profile. You'll be the same. OK. The only things that as you know you are work on is delete multistruck then today is made from bottom in the future maybe we'll be doing from store which is the reason you want to run a trial in China. OK. 1:49:34.510 --> 1:49:34.750 Ohikhuai, Henry Oh. 1:49:37.370 --> 1:49:37.530 Ohikhuai, Henry Kite. 1:49:37.990 --> 1:49:38.870 Ohikhuai, Henry No, no, no, no, no. 1:49:36.150 --> 1:49:39.470 Vinha, Fernando OK, I'll look your kind. I got your point. Try. 1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:39.920 Barrington, Kyle OK, so so to my point. How did China see that's current, but I see the the point is looking in the future. Let's say we make a change to the recipe, OK. So where how are we gonna go about documenting that, storing the specs or that detailed recipe question is how are we going to do that? And that was the question is it just going to be in Word? Is it just going to be a Word document? That's the question. 1:49:40.740 --> 1:49:41.220 Vinha, Fernando OK. 1:49:46.550 --> 1:49:47.510 Vinha, Fernando Yes. 1:49:42.160 --> 1:49:52.840 Ohikhuai, Henry OK, Kai, you have what you call quality management, system, quality management system. So everything will be done on the quality management system. 1:49:59.10 --> 1:49:59.410 Vinha, Fernando Units. 1:49:53.610 --> 1:50:4.610 Barrington, Kyle OK, so great. So that that I suppose I think was where the question was going way back. So that's what managed by Elixir or NHPIL currently. 1:50:8.120 --> 1:50:9.0 Thiagarajah, Thisan By the employees. 1:50:8.450 --> 1:50:37.370 Ohikhuai, Henry No, it will be managed by better. It will be managed by Twinings because it's Twinings that we give that approval, although it's on a lensia system, but the application or the approval to performance because it's a product quality, it must come from Twinings. Fernando will sign, I will sign, the MD will sign before he goes to Elysia to apply. 1:50:38.670 --> 1:50:50.750 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Yeah, I understand. I think you answered my question. I think my question was trying to be who owns that software and it's elixir I suppose is the answer. That's fine. I understand we control, but yeah, OK. 1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:52.440 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK, maybe. 1:50:59.350 --> 1:51:0.190 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Exactly. 1:51:0.150 --> 1:51:2.870 Barrington, Kyle I thought that's what Henry just said, wasn't it? 1:50:52.520 --> 1:51:22.480 Vinha, Fernando I'm not sure if they are like that. They have the quality control model because in China they have the quality control model. So


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the management of a recipe, its specifications, and the ingredients involved. The team is considering whether the responsibility should lie with their own employees or those of FMCR. They discuss the need for detailed specifications of all ingredients, which currently seem to be lacking locally. Fernando mentions that they have asked for these specifications and that they are necessary for audits. The team also discusses the need for a system to document and store changes to the recipe, with Henry suggesting a quality management system. The ownership of this system is clarified to be Elixir, but the control lies with their team.
