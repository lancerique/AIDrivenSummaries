monthly SOP process for which we so we get information from the sales team with based on the and what based on the let's say the relationship with the customer which can be of many different aspects, it can be a contract, it can be just a O relationship. 0:17:0.260 --> 0:17:4.30 Ricciardi Luca So that's why the information from the on the demand side are coming from the sales team. 0:17:4.120 --> 0:17:7.160 Ricciardi Luca But we have a process where we review this information. 0:17:7.170 --> 0:17:10.710 Ricciardi Luca They're actually feeding into the forecast in two basically gates. 0:17:10.720 --> 0:17:18.190 Ricciardi Luca One is directly with the individual, says manager plus one is with the regional, let's say responsible. 0:17:18.200 --> 0:17:28.60 Ricciardi Luca So we try and get to a consensus demand, which is not just what they input in the file, but we try and review it based on some analytics that we can put inside as well. 0:17:29.670 --> 0:17:29.950 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:17:31.70 --> 0:17:38.440 Dempsey Tim So to be to be clear that when the original data gets put together, it's extremely granular because it has to go out to eat cells. 0:17:38.450 --> 0:17:42.860 Dempsey Tim Person eats skew each each customer each warehouse. 0:17:42.870 --> 0:17:44.220 Dempsey Tim It's very, very granular. 0:17:44.310 --> 0:17:56.900 Dempsey Tim And then when we have our cells responsible review our kind of VP sign off before it goes into production and this is then rolled up on a product line basis to say take a step back. 0:17:56.970 --> 0:17:58.320 Dempsey Tim This is what all the guys have put in. 0:17:58.570 --> 0:18:4.950 Dempsey Tim Does it look feasible versus what we've done and where where of our biggest deltas been over the last quarter for example? 0:18:5.110 --> 0:18:13.20 Dempsey Tim And what do we need to readjust to try to try and make the the the gaps smaller and give the best broadcaster production? 0:18:13.280 --> 0:18:14.700 Dempsey Tim That's currently how we're working. 0:18:16.550 --> 0:18:19.50 Pankaj Gadekar And how often do you review your forecast? 0:18:20.220 --> 0:18:20.710 Ricciardi Luca Each month. 0:18:20.290 --> 0:18:30.400 Dempsey Tim So yeah, we we do an official review each month between sales and operations and then the sales guys are encouraged to go in. 0:18:30.450 --> 0:18:46.0 Dempsey Tim You know the files are accessed, accessible to the majority of the month, so if they receive new information, we don't, we don't want them necessarily to wait to talk to us if that's gonna be 2 weeks away and they are, they are able to update forecasts as well as as they go. 0:18:47.60 --> 0:18:47.210 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:18:48.610 --> 0:18:55.110 Pankaj Gadekar Going to give us some factual information in terms of number of SQL manufacturing plant warehouses. 0:18:56.700 --> 0:18:59.90 Ricciardi Luca Yeah, I think that these are available on our website. 0:18:59.100 --> 0:19:1.130 Ricciardi Luca So we can provide them without many issues. 0:19:1.420 --> 0:19:17.640 Ricciardi Luca We are talking about footprint of 19 plants globally, 19 manufacturing sites for what concerns my my beat it's we're talking about 10 which with the I mean number of SKU's which is in the range of. 0:19:18.430 --> 0:19:20.860 Ricciardi Luca And and I would say 5000. 0:19:24.210 --> 0:19:24.380 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:19:24.400 --> 0:19:25.270 Ricciardi Luca Maybe even more. 0:19:25.280 --> 0:19:25.760 Ricciardi Luca Tim. Tim. 0:19:24.480 --> 0:19:41.50 Dempsey Tim In just very generally guys, in terms of data points that we may want to consider for customers, SKU supply plants, about 15,000, yeah, I would say roughly speaking. 0:19:43.70 --> 0:19:43.640 Dempsey Tim Life. 0:19:43.540 --> 0:19:43.720 Ricciardi Luca Yeah. 0:19:42.930 --> 0:19:43.970 Ajay Aggarwal But Tim? 0:19:43.650 --> 0:19:44.260 Dempsey Tim Life. 0:19:44.270 --> 0:19:45.900 Dempsey Tim Life planning flows, let's say. 0:19:46.510 --> 0:19:47.50 Ajay Aggarwal Yeah, Tim. 0:19:47.60 --> 0:19:49.730 Ajay Aggarwal But at any point of time, how many are active? 0:19:49.740 --> 0:19:54.600 Ajay Aggarwal 50,000 maybe total SQL but active SK user 5000 or 15,000. 0:19:55.850 --> 0:20:1.600 Dempsey Tim So that when when we talk about these data points, we're talking about how we're forecasting currently. 0:20:2.460 --> 0:20:2.820 Ajay Aggarwal OK. 0:20:5.560 --> 0:20:5.880 Ajay Aggarwal OK. 0:20:5.930 --> 0:20:9.570 Dempsey Tim But White House level and at those levels were in putting the forecast. 0:20:9.640 --> 0:20:15.320 Dempsey Tim So that's not necessarily that the amount of skews we've got, the number that Luca quoted to you is the skew count. 0:20:16.480 --> 0:20:16.750 Ricciardi Luca Correct. 0:20:16.470 --> 0:20:21.510 Ajay Aggarwal And Luca, how many stocking points after the where the warehouses or distributors? 0:20:22.920 --> 0:20:23.910 Ricciardi Luca We can assume 40. 0:20:25.540 --> 0:20:26.530 Ajay Aggarwal Including distributors.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The monthly SOP process involves gathering information from the sales team based on their relationship with the customer. This information is reviewed and fed into the forecast in two stages: one with the individual sales manager and one with the regional responsible. The aim is to reach a consensus demand, which is reviewed based on analytics. The original data is very granular, including details for each sales person, SKU, customer, and warehouse. This data is reviewed by sales and operations each month, and sales personnel can update forecasts as new information comes in. The company has a global footprint of 19 manufacturing sites and around 15,000 data points for customers, SKUs, and supply plants. The number of active SKUs at any given time is around 5,000. The company also has around 40 stocking points, including warehouses and distributors.
