Write a concise summary of the following:


0:48:25.400 --> 0:48:53.360 Barrington, Kyle Almost the old way that Andover and Poland did it before before they put in line view exception stuff like that. I think the line view and all that sort of stuff, I think, yeah, let's consider I think that's one to consider in the future as sort of if volumes grow and and we would therefore want that sort of more granularity by line. Whereas at the moment it's quite, you know volumes aren't enough that sort of I think we'd get the the extra value from those would be my view at least. 0:48:55.430 --> 0:48:57.870 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. Make sense? 0:48:58.760 --> 0:49:10.480 Thiagarajah, Thisan Just wanted to just clarify, when we say black fresh because you've mentioned automated Madhu, I understand black flush happens when someone manually enters into the system to put what those things are. So those are manually entered numbers. 0:49:9.300 --> 0:49:11.740 Kolachalam, Madhu It it good so. 0:49:9.590 --> 0:49:40.870 Vinha, Fernando Yes, yes. If you not you, you have to to do it manually because to avoid people doing something that's not the true because first I have to produce. Suppose let's say I request 10 tonnes of bulk GM5 bulk to produce. Of course they they move this bacteria from the warehouse location to the work in process location. Once I have done it every day I go to the system and I say no, I need to request more. I don't want to do. 0:49:41.30 --> 0:49:45.710 Vinha, Fernando One production order for the whole month, it's not good to do hence. 0:49:46.200 --> 0:49:47.520 Vinha, Fernando Batch flash disord. 0:50:0.570 --> 0:50:0.890 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. 0:50:3.350 --> 0:50:4.750 Barrington, Kyle They they think that. 0:49:49.520 --> 0:50:16.0 Vinha, Fernando To have a good control to know what's going on with the factor, you can do the bad. The bad, they work on everyday and do the bad flash based on what you really did. OK so go to the system back. Flash it. OK, so people can do it. It is like a work routine. So you want to training the people you have until 9:00 AM in the morning. It's the way I I work in the other stack like China, Thailand. You know parties. 0:50:17.80 --> 0:50:51.840 Vinha, Fernando Until 9:00 AM, you have to issue a production order and send it to the warehouse guys so that guys has time to prepare to segregate and transfer it in the system and physically because I have to transfer to the working process. So the people start to work, you process it, you report it. So you create the the bad flash inside of the working process. And so you just keep going, OK. It is an end of the month. You set up a time to close the map up. This work works. Stop now. 0:50:52.660 --> 0:51:8.900 Vinha, Fernando Though you should more work hard in this map so so you start the next map, something like that you have to see how gonna to sit with a here and so they find very, very, very detail how it gonna work. OK, but it's the way you used to work in our factories. 0:51:7.960 --> 0:51:37.560 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, it is. I think for a simple way of maybe just trying to articulate what we mean by backlash is just simply like let's say you need, you're going to produce a heart 100 cartoons, but you might issue a whole pallet of 200 cartoons into a works order. But what you do is once you've closed down that production or you then go back and reissue, let's say 98 back. So I needed, I needed actually to use 102 cartoons and that's how you close off that works order effectively. 0:51:38.440 --> 0:51:39.400 Barrington, Kyle Is how I would. 0:51:39.20 --> 0:51:40.580 Vinha, Fernando Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 0:51:40.500 --> 0:51:43.900 Kolachalam, Madhu So yeah, and and and and again this on like CP. 0:51:51.370 --> 0:51:54.450 Barrington, Kyle I was just giving you an example I can get. Let's go into. 0:51:42.710 --> 0:51:54.550 Vinha, Fernando Because, Kyle, I think he just to make sure you have two kinds of work order, you have work orders for finished good product, OK that when do you? Yeah. And for the bulk. 0:51:56.0 --> 0:51:58.360 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. Yeah, so. 0:51:55.830 --> 0:51:59.470 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, yeah, I agree. I agree. I was just trying to give a simple example to understand. 0:52:0.940 --> 0:52:1.420 Kolachalam, Madhu And and. 0:51:59.640 --> 0:52:24.320 Vinha, Fernando Exactly. So first you have to produce the ball because sometimes what have if I use issue workload for finishing good and the system detector, you do not have bulk product to support your finished good order. The system automatically block it that you cannot do this work hard. So this is my help us to doing that. So you have to do it correctly. First you produce the ball. 0:52:36.590 --> 0:52:37.550 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, and and and and. 0:52:40.800 --> 0:52:42.360 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, we can do and yeah. 0:52:24.870 --> 0:52:44.310 Vinha, Fernando And late you produce a finish to good, so just keep it going. And so you monitoring the the the bulk quant


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the production process and the use of line view and exception handling for managing volumes. The team discusses the concept of "black flush" which involves manually entering data into the system. Fernando Vinha explains the need for manual entry to maintain accuracy and control, and describes the process of issuing a production order, transferring it to the warehouse, and reporting it. He also mentions the importance of training people for this routine. Kyle Barrington simplifies the concept of "black flush" by giving an example of issuing more cartoons than needed for a works order and then reissuing the unused ones. The team also discusses the importance of producing the bulk product before the finished good to avoid system blocks.
