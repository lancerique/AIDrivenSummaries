0:24:1.680 --> 0:24:14.970 Pankaj Gadekar And is it always the case that the warehouse is associated with that manufacturing plant our catering, the demand of that reason only and it's not sort of exported across the countries or a region or? 0:24:15.20 --> 0:24:16.710 Ricciardi Luca Uh, sorry. 0:24:16.720 --> 0:24:17.530 Ricciardi Luca Can I? 0:24:17.600 --> 0:24:19.930 Ricciardi Luca I didn't go to the didn't get it question. 0:24:20.680 --> 0:24:27.980 Pankaj Gadekar So for a particular reason, for example, Europe, right, whatever the demand that the Europe has is catered by the European manufacturing plants. 0:24:28.770 --> 0:24:29.320 Ricciardi Luca OK. 0:24:29.890 --> 0:24:30.750 Ricciardi Luca And no? 0:24:30.80 --> 0:24:33.30 Pankaj Gadekar All we need to import from other regions. 0:24:33.420 --> 0:24:36.610 Ricciardi Luca No, no, no, we it's a global business and footprint. 0:24:48.610 --> 0:24:49.800 Ajay Aggarwal For me, there's something that. 0:24:36.620 --> 0:24:57.70 Ricciardi Luca So it means that just to make an example, we have at at a plant in China producing for products that are going into the US or plans in in Europe are going to the US and us the tricky part because of course when you're managing the inventories, you need to to to consider that part of your buffer inventory, let's say is in the warehouse is oversea. 0:24:57.180 --> 0:25:11.290 Ricciardi Luca So you are also dealing with the lead time which is not 14 days which can ease a little bit the scenario but is a little bit longer and that's why we need to build up a supply plan at the warehouse level, especially in order to be able to build up a decent manufacturing. 0:25:11.840 --> 0:25:14.800 Ricciardi Luca Yeah, plan at the at the plant level. 0:25:14.720 --> 0:25:20.190 Pankaj Gadekar So, so who is responsible for triggering that supply? 0:25:20.200 --> 0:25:21.340 Pankaj Gadekar Is it at the warehouse level? 0:25:22.50 --> 0:25:43.360 Ricciardi Luca Yes, we the organization is basically splitting to the regions and there are people actually responsible for at a warehouse level to make sure that the warehouse is, let's say replenish accordingly to what they plan to sell out based on the inventory that they have on the ground trying to, I mean consider delete time that is is in place from each manufacturing side. 0:25:44.210 --> 0:25:46.320 Ricciardi Luca So that's to again to make an example. 0:25:46.450 --> 0:25:49.190 Ricciardi Luca There is nothing and to be hidden. 0:25:49.680 --> 0:26:10.300 Ricciardi Luca For example, we have a A whereas in Houston that can replenish from plants in Europe, which are one in the UK, one in Italy, the person responsible for the uston planning the the plan for Houston will be actually talking to the guys in the UK or to the guys in Italy to replenish their the SKU that are coming from each individual manufacturing site. 0:26:12.890 --> 0:26:13.60 Pankaj Gadekar Here. 0:26:17.300 --> 0:26:18.490 Dempsey Tim Luca, what would you? 0:26:17.40 --> 0:26:20.730 Ajay Aggarwal But it must be Pankaj because they might not be Pankaj. 0:26:19.30 --> 0:26:21.190 Dempsey Tim Sorry go. 0:26:26.150 --> 0:26:26.910 Pankaj Gadekar Of course, of course. 0:26:20.740 --> 0:26:28.720 Ajay Aggarwal It must be because they're not manufacturing every item at every plant now, so there must be some plant specifically feed serving, serving all the warehouses here. 0:26:29.370 --> 0:26:29.660 Ricciardi Luca Correct. 0:26:29.450 --> 0:26:29.850 Pankaj Gadekar Of course. 0:26:28.540 --> 0:26:29.970 Dempsey Tim Yeah, there's different. 0:26:29.980 --> 0:26:35.910 Dempsey Tim There's certain chemistries are made at certain plans because of the obviously different assets, different manufacturing processes. 0:26:36.630 --> 0:26:37.960 Dempsey Tim Uh, we do. 0:26:38.10 --> 0:26:50.640 Dempsey Tim We do have a kind of a global regional strategy for certain certain products where we can make similar or the same products in three global regions, let's say. 0:26:51.130 --> 0:26:55.300 Dempsey Tim So we can flex our our kind of business continuity planning. 0:26:55.310 --> 0:26:56.60 Dempsey Tim It's good for that. 0:26:56.310 --> 0:27:5.0 Dempsey Tim And I mean Luca on the table today, what would you say are are the biggest business challenges that we that we're trying to solve? 0:27:5.50 --> 0:27:5.640 Dempsey Tim What would you say? 0:27:7.390 --> 0:27:25.440 Ricciardi Luca From my point of view, as I said before, I mean the I would like to, I mean my my my wish list would be to have a system that is able to integrate, let's say the what is on the forecasting side and being able let's say to consider all each individual supplying plant. 0:27:25.490 --> 0:27:31.660 Ricciardi Luca We did each individual stocking point and then able to generate the replenishment plan for each month. 0:27:32.30 --> 0:27:38.990 Ricciardi Luca Yes, warehouse and then that can be fed into the the manufacturing uh plan as well. 0:27:38.690 -->


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Pankaj Gadekar and Ricciardi Luca discuss the global nature of their business, where manufacturing plants in one region, such as Europe or China, produce products for other regions, including the US. This global footprint requires careful management of inventories and lead times. The responsibility for triggering supply lies at the warehouse level, with specific individuals ensuring warehouses are replenished based on sales plans and existing inventory. They also discuss the need for a system that integrates forecasting and considers each individual supply plant and stocking point to generate a replenishment plan.
