Write a concise summary of the following:


1:6:45.100 --> 1:6:57.380 Barrington, Kyle Play with, et cetera. That for me is is an OK as an initial point, I think in the future, you're right, we may be there might be some some good opportunities to integrate. But yeah, that's sort of my prefer. 1:6:58.860 --> 1:7:20.460 Vinha, Fernando Kyle, just one question. Is it possible you buy an Alexa, just do call off as you used to do in for with the Leo technical for Coco Shalita buy all Coco? OK, but of course it is. It is. Your technical work kept out what you are saying that it will be our work kept out right for some material. 1:7:24.40 --> 1:7:38.680 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, I'm sorry for that. I know I'm bit lost. I need to go. I need to go ahead. But yes, they will be calling off. It might be our contract. They'll be calling off. But my point is they would pay the supplier directly and then it would be included within our cost of goods. So. 1:7:38.760 --> 1:7:42.840 Vinha, Fernando I saw it will be there working capital, not our work capital. 1:7:43.700 --> 1:7:46.260 Barrington, Kyle For some things, yes. Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah. 1:7:45.570 --> 1:7:47.530 Vinha, Fernando Yes, OK. 1:7:47.660 --> 1:7:49.380 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. Sorry, that was. 1:7:51.410 --> 1:8:22.250 Thiagarajah, Thisan I was just going to say, mother, that you know, when you call that different systems for Oracle Fmcl and Elixir 2 pronouncement they are the same system, but they're own different, I guess environment. So we're actually having some conversations around how do we make some of that data from fmcr visible in elixir. So part of snop process, there's IMS data that gets put into fmcl system, they forecast what they're going to sell right now. That's all taken out manually put in Excel. What we're thinking is that actually they can transfer that data over to the snop process. That's an elixir. 1:8:22.590 --> 1:8:25.990 Thiagarajah, Thisan And then manage the production and material planning as well after that. 1:8:31.110 --> 1:8:40.750 Kolachalam, Madhu Are we saying the forecasting or the demand planning would be done by fmcl, not by Twinings? Hi, how are you? 1:8:42.540 --> 1:8:43.60 Barrington, Kyle Hello. 1:8:42.120 --> 1:8:43.120 Kolachalam, Madhu What's your name? 1:8:44.240 --> 1:8:45.160 Barrington, Kyle This is Jacob. 1:8:44.640 --> 1:8:47.760 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Hello. Hi, Jacob. 1:8:48.710 --> 1:8:49.470 Thiagarajah, Thisan Hi Jacob. 1:8:52.600 --> 1:8:53.640 Kolachalam, Madhu I know. Oh. 1:8:55.310 --> 1:8:56.430 Thiagarajah, Thisan Yes, I copy and. 1:8:55.470 --> 1:8:56.670 Barrington, Kyle Sorry, carry on. 1:8:57.500 --> 1:9:4.620 Kolachalam, Madhu Very nice to see him. Meet him. Meet Jacob. Thank you. So I think Satish. And what? 1:9:6.380 --> 1:9:12.340 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. So sorry. What I'm asking is, let's take the demand planning. So we have a fmcl distributor who is. 1:9:14.200 --> 1:9:18.680 Kolachalam, Madhu Or is the Africa exports also through fmcl or is only Nigeria? 1:9:21.50 --> 1:9:24.490 Ohikhuai, Henry Only Nigeria is also separate. It's not FMC. 1:9:25.640 --> 1:9:32.440 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. So in Africa exports, do we have one, one distributor or do we have multiple distributors based on different countries? 1:9:33.650 --> 1:9:34.650 Barrington, Kyle Multiple. 1:9:35.310 --> 1:9:36.550 Ohikhuai, Henry People talk different country. 1:9:37.560 --> 1:9:58.720 Kolachalam, Madhu OK, so so the demand planning up my assumption in terms of ultimately what we want factory to produce twining sole team, there will be a demand planner who will consolidate from fmcl and other African export entities and then say this is my demand and this is what I want to feed into manufacturing entity, is that right? 1:9:59.800 --> 1:10:0.120 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. 1:10:1.360 --> 1:10:9.880 Kolachalam, Madhu So, and if that that demand is it captured in Sapb 1 today or do we capture it in Excel and just send it to Alexa? 1:10:11.590 --> 1:10:17.470 Ohikhuai, Henry Currently is captured in Azure and sent to Alicia. 1:10:18.730 --> 1:10:19.810 Ohikhuai, Henry Bye. Fancy. 1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:37.720 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. And and this and what what you are saying is that's where actually the demand planner could use this new snop tool that we you talked about and they could consolidate the demand across and feed it directly into the system which integrates with the Oracle lxs. So that's one integration opportunity definitely. 1:10:38.580 --> 1:10:40.540 Thiagarajah, Thisan Exactly the bit I use. 1:10:39.10 --> 1:11:3.530 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes, we are hopeful that the system will be able to spool from F FM CL platform. They are CS spooling to the S and OP system and then we can have the the demand forecast there. And then based on that system, we can now plan production based on the demand forecast. 1:11:4.480 --> 1:11:33.520 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it, got it. And and then what about the sales orders for is it's? Yeah, it's a sales order, right? Or a purchase order for
