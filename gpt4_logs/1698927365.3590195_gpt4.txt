four of this year we need to make some preparations. 0:42:25.520 --> 0:42:25.870 Dempsey Tim So. 0:42:26.70 --> 0:42:26.290 Joshua Savidge Umm. 0:42:25.880 --> 0:42:30.170 Dempsey Tim So how does that surge in demand suddenly impact what we do today? 0:42:30.180 --> 0:42:41.260 Dempsey Tim Because the vision or the, let's say the forecasts arizon that people are dealing with on a daily basis is quite short in terms of their vision of the order book and everything. 0:42:41.350 --> 0:42:44.400 Dempsey Tim So we need to kind of take it a bit further. 0:42:44.510 --> 0:43:5.170 Dempsey Tim The view of it further ahead and that that then links in all our warehouses and make sure that we we have the right decisions because at the moment I'll be honest at the moment it's a complex business, we had too much stock, OK globally, which meant it hit a lot of problems. 0:43:5.240 --> 0:43:10.390 Dempsey Tim OK, now that we're reduced to the inventory, we've done a really good job of giving capital back to the business. 0:43:10.880 --> 0:43:16.650 Dempsey Tim It exposes forecast accuracy, lead time, reliability, production reliability. 0:43:16.700 --> 0:43:26.10 Dempsey Tim So if if all these processes are not optimized and working well, if we, you know sales, look at it that we reduce the inventory and we crash. 0:43:33.400 --> 0:43:33.680 Joshua Savidge Umm. 0:43:26.260 --> 0:43:41.670 Dempsey Tim So what we're doing, we're optimize the inventory to the right level, but it means the subprocesses have to be very well aligned and that's what I would say is our challenge, umm, just just to add on to that and I think we've talked a lot about how we're actually planning the demand from the forecast. 0:43:49.370 --> 0:43:49.740 Ricciardi Luca Umm. 0:43:55.630 --> 0:43:55.760 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:43:41.680 --> 0:44:9.40 Dempsey Tim But I think the forecast as the input tool as well, I think that would definitely benefit from some additional technology looking at how we could use certain scenarios, certain models, certain statistical work and to actually turn out more alternation algorithm because something yeah, because we have a lot of we have a very varied level of I guess skill from all of the sales team and some of them are really good, some of them not so good. 0:44:9.50 --> 0:44:23.170 Dempsey Tim So I mean, if I in the past I've run, I've run statistical on in in conjunction with adjusted sales suggested forecasts and actually modeled in reality over real time which one came out with the best results. 0:44:23.180 --> 0:44:33.460 Dempsey Tim So I mean that would be a real good kind of early way to prove to the business look technology is is is a big part of getting your forecast right, being able to predict swings. 0:44:34.560 --> 0:44:34.960 Pankaj Gadekar So I. 0:44:33.570 --> 0:44:40.710 Dempsey Tim I mean, if we could improve forecast accuracy by using a technology tool, it would do two things. 0:44:40.900 --> 0:44:42.750 Dempsey Tim It would improve our service to the customer. 0:44:43.130 --> 0:44:43.270 Pankaj Gadekar Yes. 0:44:43.260 --> 0:44:59.270 Dempsey Tim It would do it with reduced inventory and it would release hours of time for sales to concentrate on selling and not crunching numbers or guessing or trying to bridge the forecast of the budget and put fictitious numbers in the plan because they need to hit hit a number. 0:44:59.340 --> 0:45:4.0 Dempsey Tim So you know, but, but it's a real it's a real paradigm shift. 0:45:5.170 --> 0:45:6.450 Pankaj Gadekar It is please. 0:45:4.10 --> 0:45:13.260 Dempsey Tim This is it's fundamental to the business because the mentality at the moment is sales forecast and you have to tell us what the customer needs or what the market needs. 0:45:13.710 --> 0:45:22.200 Dempsey Tim Those guys might not know over 400 lines in their personal portfolio what they you know they need the year so much time, how much time do they have to do that. 0:45:22.210 --> 0:45:36.970 Dempsey Tim So if if the technology we could say guys, we've got this OK, you tell a significant future promotions, future events, product launches, all the rest of it, the historical stuff will throw some algorithms at this and we'll come up with the best fit. 0:45:36.980 --> 0:45:38.100 Dempsey Tim Yeah, you know. 0:45:38.110 --> 0:45:40.450 Dempsey Tim And so as we mentioned, not everything's gonna fit well. 0:45:45.860 --> 0:45:46.500 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah, yeah. 0:45:40.460 --> 0:45:53.820 Dempsey Tim We know there is volatility in our business, but if we can get the stuff that does work working that would save a lot of time and I think it will all be incremental and you know introducing that is a big shock to the custody. 0:45:54.400 --> 0:45:54.760 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah, yeah. 0:45:53.830 --> 0:45:59.700 Dempsey Tim But it's the only way I can see if we going forward because we it just gets more and more complex every year. 0:46:1.680 --> 0:46:2.300 Pankaj Gadekar What else happened? 0:45:59.740 -->


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the need for better forecasting and inventory management in the business. Dempsey Tim highlights the challenges of dealing with short-term visions and the complexity of their business, which has led to issues with excess stock. He mentions that they have managed to reduce inventory, giving capital back to the business, but this has exposed issues with forecast accuracy, lead time, and production reliability. He suggests the use of technology to improve forecast accuracy, which would improve customer service, reduce inventory, and free up time for the sales team. He emphasizes the need for a paradigm shift in the business, moving away from sales forecasts and towards technology-driven forecasting.
