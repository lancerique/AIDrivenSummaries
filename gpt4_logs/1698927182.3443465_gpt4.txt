Write a concise summary of the following:


need to set up now with Elixir being a vendor, how much flexibility do we have to tell them this is exactly how we need you to set up the our data or will they say we are a supplier, we'll figure out our systems, our thing we're going to give you or will they be open to telling exactly the setting, the process. 0:31:27.710 --> 0:31:30.430 Barrington, Kyle I think my my promise might will be. 0:31:26.570 --> 0:31:32.170 Vinha, Fernando Yeah, I I want to have clarit on the. Sorry, I'm pretty sorry. 0:31:32.730 --> 0:31:34.170 Barrington, Kyle OK. I'll quickly go. Sorry, Fernando. 0:31:35.0 --> 0:31:35.680 Vinha, Fernando OK. 0:31:37.290 --> 0:32:6.290 Barrington, Kyle The discussion we've had is that they are super flexible and they will do meet our requirements. Now the proof will come in the pudding when we actually come down to that now. And also I suppose if we're asking for something that they say we can't do, there's going to be cost implications. Again, we might have to consider that when it comes to it, but the the conversations have been that we are super flexible and we want to sort of support and and and we're willing to adapt to suit sort of what you need. 0:32:17.170 --> 0:32:17.370 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK. 0:32:31.820 --> 0:32:32.60 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 0:32:7.540 --> 0:32:32.340 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. So until from a transparency standpoint, would they be because if if they do set up the process the way we want and give us access to the system and just the data generating that variance could happen a weekly basis on a monthly basis at at at any level time you want and it it could slice and dice data, but will they give us that full data access and transparency or do you believe that that would be OK? 0:32:33.690 --> 0:32:42.810 Barrington, Kyle I believe so. Again, I'll I'll point it. I'll look to maybe Henry in a Jiro based on sort of past experience, but my my gut is yes they they they will. 0:32:43.810 --> 0:32:44.810 Kolachalam, Madhu OK, great. 0:32:43.750 --> 0:32:45.630 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So to that point. 0:32:44.460 --> 0:33:15.140 Vinha, Fernando Yes, because yes, because you have to assess this is been a daily busy days because we are running the the day-to-day operation. How did day-to-day operation works? I have everyday intuition the the the production, the work order. So I need to assess this is a print it out sent to the warehouse make all transaction. This is our team you want to do the IT in the future. So for sure I think you have this clarity I I I think it will be it will be our our environmental OK. 0:33:15.180 --> 0:33:19.900 Vinha, Fernando Inside of our system, OK, we need to have our our place inside office. 0:33:20.740 --> 0:33:22.340 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it, got it. 0:33:24.170 --> 0:33:24.850 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 0:33:20.380 --> 0:33:51.740 Vinha, Fernando OK, we have to create it. OK. And so we have to have a password to access this space inside of Oracle that belongs to us. So you manage it in a day-to-day operation because we have to, to, to buy machinery every day. It comes to the fact you have to release it. You are all you want to do it in a day-to-day operations. Our day-to-day operation every day you have to do that. So you need to assess the system every day. So I believe in the future. Alexa, you're gonna give us. 0:33:52.420 --> 0:34:1.180 Vinha, Fernando Who the name of the people that can assess the seisma you you have to provide the password you just enter and assess the system and so you can work everyday. 0:34:23.810 --> 0:34:24.930 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 0:34:1.780 --> 0:34:29.380 Vinha, Fernando OK, because I have to do the batch flash to import the the finished good product so people can go to the system and say, ah, I have these SK US available for sales on. I don't have material I have an offer on my Cheeto. So all these things have to set up in the system, OK for sure you need it in the future. You need to assess it. If not cannot do work because we'll be asked myself and Andy that you want to run in this operation in the future. OK. 0:34:44.610 --> 0:34:47.730 Vinha, Fernando Yes, right. Variance. Yes. OK. 0:34:30.100 --> 0:34:56.580 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. And and and infinite actually look to you. You are absolutely right. Right. So Oracle or ASAP both support and Oracle actually also supports everything, right in terms of purchase price variance in voice price variance, manufacturing variance categorising or it. So it does that. So now what what is when you bring that back into a reporting and a streamline that's where there is an effort. But that's a reporting solution we can figure that out. 0:34:57.740 --> 0:34:58.420 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, but. 0:35:2.920 --> 0:35:3.240 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. 0:35:15.280 --> 0:35:15.720 Kolachalam, Madhu Yes. 0:34:56.80 --> 0:35:25.400 Vinha, Fernando Exactly, exactly. I need the my I need my PPV every month so I don't need to wait three months to go to the fact if I pay the the standard


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team is discussing the setup with Elixir, a new vendor. They are questioning the level of flexibility Elixir will provide in setting up their data systems. Barrington, Kyle assures the team that Elixir has been very flexible and willing to meet their requirements, but there may be cost implications if they ask for something Elixir can't do. The team also discusses the need for full data access and transparency, which Barrington, Kyle believes Elixir will provide. Vinha, Fernando emphasizes the need for daily access to the system for day-to-day operations. The team also discusses the capabilities of Oracle in supporting their needs.
