PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


sort of the the application side of things in terms of how we're, how we're performing, where do we need to focus. 0:9:15.560 --> 0:9:31.800 Barrington, Kyle You know where there's room for improvement? Where can we improve operations? Where are we losing? What waste or all these sort of things and that's obviously going to drive the way sort of the data that we need out of the system and for elixir to be able to share with us. 0:9:44.410 --> 0:9:45.90 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 0:9:32.960 --> 0:10:1.880 Barrington, Kyle And then ultimately obviously which all I suppose drive how how the ERP system and how how all the applications are sort of set up to to run a leap of sort of how I see it. But hopefully that gives A and I can answer any other questions and thoughts on the, the the business model, but sort of that sort of I suppose that probably the high level key key points we can go into any specifics obviously some of we're still sort of in the process of negotiating with. 0:10:3.520 --> 0:10:6.800 Barrington, Kyle Alexia and and finalising all those points. 0:10:8.360 --> 0:10:12.80 Barrington, Kyle They effectively run on a model of. We will do anything you want. 0:10:14.80 --> 0:10:25.560 Barrington, Kyle And operate in the manner that you ask us for. So you know, there might be some back and forth around what things we're responsible for versus exactly what they're responsible for and defining the relationship. 0:10:27.240 --> 0:10:28.80 Barrington, Kyle Really. Clearly. 0:10:29.200 --> 0:10:34.80 Barrington, Kyle But broadly, that's sort of the principle of what I would say is the the business model. 0:10:35.460 --> 0:10:35.900 Vinha, Fernando OK. 0:10:35.180 --> 0:11:3.860 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. So I had one question. Kyle or Adro or like so basically I just want to validate my understanding. So we're setting up a factory worn by us, but run by elixir with the model that you described Kyle and and then I'll come to the procurement, but let us say they are the material they're producing it. Then they ship the products to twining. We have another legal entity which is Twining sole team, legal entity in Nigeria, right. 0:11:4.140 --> 0:11:9.420 Kolachalam, Madhu Joining so our Volt in our TW or Nigerian is that the right thing? 0:11:10.710 --> 0:11:14.270 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. So effectively, so the model currently works. 0:11:16.110 --> 0:11:22.670 Barrington, Kyle And and this is maybe a subtle change. So because we're buying Pat, we buy powder from China. 0:11:24.430 --> 0:11:32.710 Barrington, Kyle Effectively, we buy the powder from China, we sell it onto them. They then produce and we buy it back at a finished goods price. 0:11:34.470 --> 0:11:43.670 Barrington, Kyle So. So that's current in the future, the plan is they will buy as many things directly because they don't have this into company relationship. 0:11:45.150 --> 0:11:51.670 Barrington, Kyle All that intercom video **** will go away because we'll just be buying raw materials directly from suppliers. So for example, liquid. 0:11:50.990 --> 0:11:53.550 Kolachalam, Madhu Alexa will buy directly from the suppliers. 0:11:53.670 --> 0:11:55.190 Vinha, Fernando Yes, yes. 0:11:54.770 --> 0:11:55.250 Kolachalam, Madhu Yes. 0:11:53.760 --> 0:12:4.920 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, not exactly the only reason they might not, and this is sort of the detail for example, is for goods that we think need to be imported. They are going to charge us. 0:12:20.120 --> 0:12:20.360 Kolachalam, Madhu Dot. 0:12:6.600 --> 0:12:23.760 Barrington, Kyle A working capital premium potentially on importing some of those products. So that's an example of thing where we might say, well, they charge a premium. We don't think it's worth it. So we might buy it and then sell it on to them. That is a slightly new one. I mean it's it's getting quite specific there, but yeah. 0:12:24.240 --> 0:12:28.760 Barrington, Kyle There's stuff like that that needs to work too, but principally they will be buying all the materials going forward. 0:12:30.460 --> 0:12:31.140 Barrington, Kyle Right. 0:12:29.650 --> 0:12:33.570 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. And and then with the they produce it, sorry. 0:12:33.140 --> 0:12:38.220 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, exactly. Then they'll produce and then they'll sell it to us. So yeah. 0:12:46.700 --> 0:12:47.260 Barrington, Kyle OK. 0:12:37.930 --> 0:12:48.250 Kolachalam, Madhu And once they sell it to us, then they're selling it to Twinings Nigeria legal entity. And we do. We sell to retail or do we only sell to trading partners or distributors? 0:12:49.40 --> 0:12:50.240 Vinha, Fernando I just completely. 0:12:51.120 --> 0:12:51.480 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Ha ha ha ha. 0:12:48.730 --> 0:13:1.90 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. So they say, yeah. And they have this wider group. There's a company called Elixir that we're talking about. They do the manufacturing side. They also have. 0:13:2.890 --> 0:13:18.690 Barrington, Kyle A distribution part of the same group and they


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the operational performance of an application and areas for improvement. The conversation involves Barrington, Kyle, Kolachalam, Madhu, and Vinha, Fernando. They discuss the business model of a factory owned by them but run by Elixir. The model involves Elixir buying raw materials directly from suppliers, producing the goods, and then selling the finished products to Twinings Nigeria legal entity. The team is still finalizing the details of this model and defining the responsibilities of each party. They also discuss the potential for a working capital premium on imported products.
