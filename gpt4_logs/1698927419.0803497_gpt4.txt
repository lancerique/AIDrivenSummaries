Dempsey Tim This is the kind of world where I would say like complexity wise our data points that were saying before about 15,000 that we forecast on in a year about a third of them could migrate to a different flow either stop selling or mover which a different warehouse, different products that there is dramatic movements each year at which point we then have to clean up the old ones. 0:49:50.560 --> 0:49:52.960 Dempsey Tim And yeah, there's there's a lot of change, yeah. 0:49:53.910 --> 0:50:2.360 Ricciardi Luca Yeah, by by nature, I mean acquiring companies sometimes just, you know, the same product coming from the same location needs to have two different codes. 0:50:2.370 --> 0:50:5.80 Ricciardi Luca One, because the company itself was not in SAP. 0:50:5.90 --> 0:50:9.290 Ricciardi Luca So we have when we have integrated them, then we have a full set of SAP. 0:50:14.240 --> 0:50:14.450 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:50:9.370 --> 0:50:15.0 Ricciardi Luca So I mean, there are these kind of scenarios that we would need to look into at some point if we go for it. 0:50:15.600 --> 0:50:15.790 Joshua Savidge Mm-hmm. 0:50:15.250 --> 0:50:27.340 Ricciardi Luca But yeah, I would say that at the moment that's something that we can improve, but potentially I mean an easier tool to handle these things can can do, can can help us out in improving also this at SKU management part let's say. 0:50:27.410 --> 0:50:32.820 Pankaj Gadekar Questions and uh promotional management where? 0:50:32.830 --> 0:50:34.890 Pankaj Gadekar Where it gets decided and how it gets applied. 0:50:38.870 --> 0:50:39.70 Dempsey Tim No. 0:50:35.830 --> 0:50:40.30 Ricciardi Luca Yeah, I I would say that we are not a company that works with the promotions. 0:50:39.950 --> 0:50:41.430 Dempsey Tim Well, the more. 0:50:40.440 --> 0:50:49.290 Ricciardi Luca So it's not, I mean we are more, let's say, driven by the decisions of the business to place the price at certain point. 0:50:49.490 --> 0:50:49.720 Dempsey Tim Umm. 0:50:49.360 --> 0:50:52.890 Ricciardi Luca But that that is valid for, let's say customers, chemistry. 0:50:56.120 --> 0:50:56.360 Dempsey Tim Yes. 0:50:59.780 --> 0:51:0.400 Dempsey Tim It's not. 0:51:0.460 --> 0:51:1.910 Dempsey Tim No, it's not retail. 0:50:53.410 --> 0:51:2.560 Ricciardi Luca And but I mean, there is not a a point in time where somebody comes and say we are gonna be making a promotion for this specific no. 0:51:3.160 --> 0:51:3.420 Joshua Savidge Umm. 0:51:1.920 --> 0:51:7.330 Dempsey Tim It's not retail where we have, you know, near the point of sale you have on the aisle, end of aisle promotions. 0:51:7.340 --> 0:51:8.190 Dempsey Tim We're not like that. 0:51:8.720 --> 0:51:8.880 Ricciardi Luca No. 0:51:8.300 --> 0:51:10.890 Dempsey Tim We're more RF RFQ related. 0:51:10.900 --> 0:51:27.890 Dempsey Tim So in in certain regions we we have tender tender for blocks of business that are that are fairly fixed and then that's where the scenario planning would help because you know depending on the price we might get 40% of the business we might get 100, we might get 60%. 0:51:27.960 --> 0:51:30.140 Dempsey Tim So that's that's a factor. 0:51:30.550 --> 0:51:40.160 Dempsey Tim Another factor is we we have tolling agreements that we we will toll certain volumes for a period of time for for other chemical companies. 0:51:40.310 --> 0:51:44.380 Dempsey Tim So that's another kind of segment of our demand or production. 0:51:54.750 --> 0:51:54.990 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:51:44.550 --> 0:51:55.390 Dempsey Tim And then and then you have commodities where we're not the only player in town and that could be impacted by China dropping material in at a cheaper price. 0:51:56.120 --> 0:51:56.350 Joshua Savidge Umm. 0:51:55.400 --> 0:51:57.250 Dempsey Tim And so so that's an impact. 0:52:8.820 --> 0:52:10.60 Ricciardi Luca Offer to buy the market, yeah. 0:51:57.320 --> 0:52:10.450 Dempsey Tim But then we also have innovation and specialty solution type products that are at higher margins solution based selling that is less driven by monetization. 0:52:10.780 --> 0:52:11.210 Dempsey Tim Yeah. 0:52:11.220 --> 0:52:13.350 Dempsey Tim So there's lots of different. 0:52:14.680 --> 0:52:33.590 Dempsey Tim Characteristics of our business that we can see based upon you know make to stop make to order frequency of selling and there's lots of work we could do within the range to almost think of a main component planning based based elements. 0:52:33.690 --> 0:52:40.870 Dempsey Tim So that all the private labels and and all the aliases of products that we make are coming from a standard unit. 0:52:51.620 --> 0:52:51.840 Ricciardi Luca So. 0:52:40.960 --> 0:52:52.30 Dempsey Tim So main I mean I've worked all the companies where we've had main component planning which is great for production and then you manage the fill outs almost just in time in the warehouse, can customization. 0:52:54.990 --> 0:52:55.170 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:52:59.520 -->
