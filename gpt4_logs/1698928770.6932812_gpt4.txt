0:20:27.670 --> 0:20:33.80 Ricciardi Luca DISTRIBUTORS to us are just, uh customers, so we don't plan for our distributors. 0:20:38.240 --> 0:20:38.560 Ajay Aggarwal OK. 0:20:33.670 --> 0:20:45.150 Ricciardi Luca So to me, a distribution point is a warehouse and a warehouse that we control directly, which means, yeah, as I said, in the range of 4040 supplying points. 0:20:45.990 --> 0:20:46.740 Ajay Aggarwal OK. 0:20:46.830 --> 0:20:55.100 Ajay Aggarwal And you do forecasting of sales forecasting, do you also how do you distribute that sales forecast at the at the stocking point level? 0:20:56.460 --> 0:21:1.650 Ricciardi Luca But actually the forecast is then basically split into every single warehouse. 0:21:8.520 --> 0:21:8.750 Ajay Aggarwal Mm-hmm. 0:21:2.110 --> 0:21:21.440 Ricciardi Luca Uh, for that we it it needs to consider the demand that is actually hitting on that specific warehouse and at that warehouse level they will be doing the, I mean each responsible at the warehouse level will be doing the supply plan let's say to make sure that they replenish the stock accordingly to what they they forecast of course. 0:21:30.260 --> 0:21:30.490 Ajay Aggarwal Umm. 0:21:21.860 --> 0:21:37.750 Ricciardi Luca And then this number that is generated fits then back the the plans because of course the plan will need to see the demand that we need to supply to the warehouse is in order to consider into their production planning. 0:21:37.760 --> 0:21:42.750 Ricciardi Luca You know, so it's that's why the system contains a couple of buffers. 0:21:42.760 --> 0:21:44.370 Ricciardi Luca Basically where we can put stock. 0:21:44.380 --> 0:21:51.390 Ricciardi Luca The first one is a warehouse and then you've got to show the plant that needs also to plan their production and the romance accordingly. 0:22:4.50 --> 0:22:4.330 Ajay Aggarwal Hmm. 0:21:51.400 --> 0:22:4.520 Ricciardi Luca So, and that's why we need to break down the forecast per warehouse level and then we again consolidate everything back into the the plant level to make sure that we have a full control. 0:22:6.0 --> 0:22:8.610 Ajay Aggarwal Now one more question Lucas, it related to this. 0:22:8.800 --> 0:22:13.60 Ajay Aggarwal Ohh is the customers or stroke distributors? 0:22:13.380 --> 0:22:19.660 Ajay Aggarwal Are they assigned to every warehouse that this customer would only be served from this warehouse or they can be served from any warehouse? 0:22:27.430 --> 0:22:27.670 Ajay Aggarwal Umm. 0:22:20.220 --> 0:22:34.150 Ricciardi Luca Let's say that in principle we are planning to target any to assign each customer to a specific warehouse, and now it gets a little bit more complicated when it comes to the US because of the the nature of the the country let's say. 0:22:34.820 --> 0:22:35.60 Ajay Aggarwal Umm. 0:22:40.530 --> 0:22:40.850 Ajay Aggarwal OK. 0:22:34.160 --> 0:22:43.290 Ricciardi Luca But let let's assume that in general we have one customer assigned to only one supply in point, and that's in general. 0:22:43.300 --> 0:22:48.730 Ricciardi Luca But we also we also have the the flexibility in case needed to supply the customer from other warehouses. 0:22:48.740 --> 0:22:52.390 Ricciardi Luca So it's not a a binding link. 0:22:53.40 --> 0:22:53.360 Ajay Aggarwal Umm. 0:23:0.180 --> 0:23:0.440 Ajay Aggarwal Umm. 0:22:52.840 --> 0:23:1.670 Ricciardi Luca I mean in case of any, for example, if just to make make an easy one, if we are overstocking one warehouse then we want to get rid of the stock before bringing any stocking in the region. 0:23:2.230 --> 0:23:2.400 Ajay Aggarwal Umm. 0:23:1.800 --> 0:23:5.20 Ricciardi Luca We then use that that warehouse to supply the customer. 0:23:6.370 --> 0:23:6.950 Ajay Aggarwal Alright. 0:23:7.20 --> 0:23:7.910 Ajay Aggarwal OK, thank you. 0:23:13.300 --> 0:23:14.290 Ajay Aggarwal Well, good anymore. 0:23:14.680 --> 0:23:15.360 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:23:22.200 --> 0:23:22.340 Ricciardi Luca Yes. 0:23:16.260 --> 0:23:24.760 Pankaj Gadekar And these manufacturing plants, are they exclusive for certain SQL or all the manufacturing sort of produce everything? 0:23:25.770 --> 0:23:26.460 Ricciardi Luca No, no, no. 0:23:26.470 --> 0:23:27.460 Ricciardi Luca Uh, usually. 0:23:27.470 --> 0:23:38.500 Ricciardi Luca I mean, each plant has their own set of products, but even when there are, I mean there are some cases where the productions are actually can be overlapped a bit. 0:23:38.950 --> 0:23:42.960 Ricciardi Luca But we have a dedicated SKU per each manufacturing side. 0:23:42.970 --> 0:23:50.720 Ricciardi Luca So just to to explain this a little bit better, if the same product is produced in two manufacturing sites, we have two different SKU's. 0:23:50.730 --> 0:24:0.120 Ricciardi Luca 'S so in terms of planning disease, a little bit the scenario, because of course we don't have one SKU that can be procured or yeah produced in two manufacturing sites. 0:24:7.330 --> 0:24:8.180 Dempsey Tim You wanna say something?


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Ricciardi Luca explains that distributors are viewed as customers and they don't plan for distributors. Instead, they consider distribution points as warehouses that they control directly. Sales forecasts are split into every single warehouse, considering the demand at each specific warehouse. Each warehouse is responsible for its supply plan to replenish stock according to their forecast. The forecast is then consolidated back into the plant level for full control. Customers are generally assigned to a specific warehouse, but there is flexibility to supply from other warehouses if needed. Each manufacturing plant has its own set of products, with dedicated SKUs for each site.
