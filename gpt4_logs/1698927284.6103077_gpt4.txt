0:31:9.210 --> 0:31:9.980 Ricciardi Luca So I will. 0:31:10.30 --> 0:31:26.290 Ricciardi Luca I mean, ideally that's in, it would be nice to maybe to, I mean to move our focus instead of actually spending time on replenishing the warehouses to find a strategy to say, OK, let's make sure that we keep fix the working capital that we have in our warehouses. 0:31:26.300 --> 0:31:27.0 Ricciardi Luca You know what I mean? 0:31:27.10 --> 0:31:30.470 Ricciardi Luca So that's what we, I mean at the moment we're also missing. 0:31:31.320 --> 0:31:31.620 Pankaj Gadekar Yeah. 0:31:32.40 --> 0:31:39.330 Pankaj Gadekar And you mentioned some of the systems and I I was not there in the previous meeting, so please pardon if I'm repeating that question. 0:31:39.340 --> 0:31:42.50 Pankaj Gadekar But I understood that you have SAP. 0:31:42.60 --> 0:31:45.380 Pankaj Gadekar Is it a global instance used by all manufacturing plants? 0:31:46.200 --> 0:31:46.320 Dempsey Tim Yes. 0:31:46.270 --> 0:31:47.420 Ricciardi Luca And yes. 0:31:48.520 --> 0:31:49.170 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:31:49.350 --> 0:31:54.380 Pankaj Gadekar And are we not using IBP or SNOP within SAP? 0:31:55.420 --> 0:31:55.600 Dempsey Tim No. 0:31:55.20 --> 0:31:56.120 Ricciardi Luca No, not at the moment. 0:31:56.970 --> 0:31:57.570 Pankaj Gadekar Not at the moment. 0:31:58.610 --> 0:32:12.250 Pankaj Gadekar So this this data that we create with, you know from a very granular from a sales perspective to rolled up to manufacturing is that then fade into SAP to do a a production planning. 0:32:13.460 --> 0:32:13.830 Ricciardi Luca Yeah. 0:32:13.840 --> 0:32:14.550 Ricciardi Luca Yes they are. 0:32:14.560 --> 0:32:15.370 Ricciardi Luca But they are. 0:32:15.420 --> 0:32:15.640 Ricciardi Luca Uh. 0:32:15.650 --> 0:32:22.450 Ricciardi Luca Through an external process and then putting SAP using DMM module and the production model. 0:32:22.460 --> 0:32:27.110 Ricciardi Luca Let's say yeah, teach money individual manufacturing sites through a manual approach completely. 0:32:27.730 --> 0:32:27.900 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:32:27.220 --> 0:32:35.110 Ricciardi Luca So just OK, we create a production orders based on the top level volumes that we have agreed to produce. 0:32:35.360 --> 0:32:42.570 Ricciardi Luca But this is not nourish scheduling, so we don't have a software to shadow productions and reshuffle accordingly. 0:32:42.820 --> 0:32:43.480 Ricciardi Luca And nor. 0:32:45.910 --> 0:32:46.90 Dempsey Tim Umm. 0:32:43.980 --> 0:32:47.360 Ricciardi Luca Uh, an MPs or anything that can be a master production should any. 0:32:47.410 --> 0:32:48.370 Ricciardi Luca No, nothing on this. 0:32:49.570 --> 0:32:50.280 Pankaj Gadekar So you talk. 0:32:49.320 --> 0:32:50.350 Dempsey Tim So we're we're missing that. 0:32:50.580 --> 0:33:0.270 Dempsey Tim The supply network planning element basically that you would get with IBP or a PO or any SAT based planning system, that's the big piece that's missing. 0:33:1.340 --> 0:33:1.620 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:33:2.930 --> 0:33:9.380 Pankaj Gadekar And a just which all processes are catered in current SF SAP. 0:33:11.650 --> 0:33:16.960 Ricciardi Luca And yes, I mean we so SAP now maps all the aspects. 0:33:16.970 --> 0:33:22.190 Ricciardi Luca So from the production to to final distribution to sales to customers. 0:33:22.260 --> 0:33:28.30 Ricciardi Luca So at the moment there is nothing that is any and there are no software that there are actually interfering with. 0:33:28.40 --> 0:33:29.290 Ricciardi Luca What SAP is doing? 0:33:29.220 --> 0:33:29.480 Pankaj Gadekar OK. 0:33:29.620 --> 0:33:33.640 Ricciardi Luca Which is a good thing, but at the same time, for us at the moment is a little bit of a limitating factor. 0:33:34.600 --> 0:33:35.860 Pankaj Gadekar And warehouse management. 0:33:37.900 --> 0:33:38.310 Pankaj Gadekar Inventory. 0:33:37.840 --> 0:33:40.490 Ricciardi Luca And Nope, it depends. 0:33:40.820 --> 0:33:46.710 Ricciardi Luca Some plants have got the the warehouse module activated, some others they don't. 0:33:46.720 --> 0:33:48.940 Ricciardi Luca So it's a mixed scenario. 0:33:50.920 --> 0:34:2.440 Pankaj Gadekar Then would you be open to have something in parallel to your ERP which can give a complete, holistic view of end to end process which has an automated way of triggering or creating actions? 0:34:4.0 --> 0:34:8.390 Pankaj Gadekar And prompting you to take certain decisions based on the insights data. 0:34:8.740 --> 0:34:12.270 Pankaj Gadekar Which of course includes the forecast. 0:34:12.280 --> 0:34:22.550 Pankaj Gadekar But you know, if I hear you would like to have that holistic view of what is the production has done, was it based on the forecast, was there any impact? 0:34:22.760 --> 0:34:27.140 Pankaj Gadekar What is its impact in further down on the logistics then coming to your warehouse? 0:34:27.150 --> 0:34:28.770 Pankaj Gadekar What are the current inventory levels? 0:34:29.700 --> 0:34:39.380 Pankaj Gadekar


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Ricciardi Luca suggests shifting focus from replenishing warehouses to maintaining the working capital in them. Pankaj Gadekar inquires about the use of SAP in all manufacturing plants, which is confirmed by Dempsey Tim and Ricciardi Luca. They also confirm that they are not currently using IBP or SNOP within SAP. The data created from sales to manufacturing is fed into SAP for production planning through an external process. However, they lack a software to schedule and reshuffle productions. SAP maps all aspects from production to final distribution to sales to customers, but some plants have the warehouse module activated while others don't. Pankaj Gadekar proposes a parallel system to ERP that provides a holistic view of the end-to-end process and triggers automated actions based on data insights.
