Write a concise summary of the following:


actually are our distributors company called Fmcl. Now what happens currently is as soon as the products are produced, they basically go through a a warehouse door and that warehouse. 0:13:31.150 --> 0:13:31.430 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 0:13:38.940 --> 0:13:39.300 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 0:13:19.210 --> 0:13:43.810 Barrington, Kyle House is owned by Fmcl, so effectively what happens? There's almost immediate back-to-back elixir sell us the product we sell the product to fmcl almost back-to-back and the goods go straight from the end of our packing line through to FMC LS warehouse. It's all part of the same building. Now, that's one thing we need to. That's one thing. We're sort of going to be discussing with. 0:13:45.330 --> 0:13:50.650 Barrington, Kyle Well, fmcl analysts here in in the future operation because we want to. 0:14:13.160 --> 0:14:13.840 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 0:13:51.590 --> 0:14:16.670 Barrington, Kyle In an ideal world, we'll rent out a portion of our new factory to fmcl to users warehousing space and we will effectively have tried to have the same operation where goods will go straight from our end, end of line straight into the warehouse that is owned by Fmcl and will trigger effectively the same back-to-back sale that we currently do. So NHYL will sell to us, will immediately sell for fmcl. 0:14:19.10 --> 0:14:19.170 Osusuluwa, Ejiro OK. 0:14:17.640 --> 0:14:21.320 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. So so I I want go ahead Idra, sorry. 0:14:21.990 --> 0:14:22.150 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Hey. 0:14:22.160 --> 0:14:22.360 Barrington, Kyle OK. 0:14:22.230 --> 0:14:40.230 Vinha, Fernando No, just I think Kyle, the main changes from rating model in my understand because today you import this bulk product from China and back it locally, OK and then the future you gonna produce the bulk. 0:14:41.290 --> 0:14:54.130 Vinha, Fernando In Nigeria, so of course you have to buy all the material and also have all the utilities, everything link to this, not just buying raw material and pack material. 0:14:55.570 --> 0:15:13.90 Vinha, Fernando Pack material you have been buy already there, so we need to buy all this raw material. All incorporate all the utility cost into the product cost. I'm thinking in terms of the the business model definition, I think it is almost defined in my understand I think you need just to Polish it. 0:15:14.800 --> 0:15:15.320 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 0:15:13.410 --> 0:15:42.890 Vinha, Fernando OK, I think going to the the system you're gonna use in the future, I think one definition you wanna do is to work based on standard cost. What does it means? Are you gonna have a stamp bill of material for all items and financial team as Kyle and you're gonna prove it after that. I agree. What your bill of material. I agree with the loss you have built your standard. OK. It's make sense because it's not 1 to one. 0:15:43.570 --> 0:15:50.530 Vinha, Fernando It's always you build some build some wasted inside of the bill of material. So you have to have all these ACK US. 0:15:50.970 --> 0:16:24.170 Vinha, Fernando OK, that you have in a sheet today, you have to create a bill of material very well instruct where packet today the usage for each material, the cost, OK and all the utilities cost incorporated and labour cost maintaining into the bill of material, it will be always standard cost for always K use. I think it is the hard work to be done because it's not so easy to say but not easy to to to implement it your SAP one or whatever system you want to use in the future. 0:16:24.380 --> 0:16:57.60 Vinha, Fernando So it is the, it is some definition. So one definition have to agree. We all that you want to work based on its standard cost. It is the concept you want to use in the future because. So Kai Kai want to compare the effective performance versus what versus the standard cost you have set up in the system in the RP system. So every month I have the actor, I do it versus the standard cost and this is my has to say for now that he is your variance is you have. 0:16:57.100 --> 0:17:6.620 Vinha, Fernando OK, you use more like select multi strack than your standard use more label that you should be using. What is going on in your factory. 0:17:7.60 --> 0:17:38.340 Vinha, Fernando So you could manage that fact. So we have it to be read in October to have all these documents inside your database in the EDC database. So to start to start. So what you have to do from now is to establish to make clear all this bill of materials done correctly approved and so who we want to insert in in Daily SHIELD database or wherever in their family cell database and how it going to work, how we want to share that as how these things has to be defined. 0:17:38.880 --> 0:17:39.640 Vinha, Fernando OK. 0:17:39.220 --> 0:18:8.300 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. And Fernando actually will come to that. I have one question one level above, right. So basically there are three core entities. There is Alexa doing manufacturing, there


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The company's distributor, Fmcl, receives products directly from the production line through a warehouse that is part of the same building. The company is considering renting a portion of their new factory to Fmcl for warehousing space, maintaining the same operation where goods go straight from the end of the production line to the Fmcl-owned warehouse. This would trigger the same back-to-back sale process currently in place. In the future, the company plans to produce bulk products locally, incorporating all utility costs into the product cost. They aim to work based on a standard cost, comparing actual performance against the standard cost set up in the system. This requires creating a detailed bill of materials, including each material's usage and cost, and incorporating all utility and labor costs. This information will be stored in the company's database for future reference and management.
