CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Dempsey Tim and Joshua Savidge discussed their next steps in a call, including getting input from the top decision-maker. They agreed to review a marked-up version of a document and further discuss their solution, including how it differs from IBP. Tim requested marketing material for further understanding. Joshua acknowledged an issue with email addresses and promised to send the material. They discussed conducting an in-depth workshop, which would take half to a full day. They also discussed a "$0.00 approach" until an agreement is reached, with a deep dive and workshop to map out the current state at no cost. Costs would be agreed upon after the deep dive and sign-off phase.
