Write a concise summary of the following:


them off to have to to to do some routine to close them off because I have close them up all these things so getting getting the reporter. 0:43:47.670 --> 0:43:47.910 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. 0:43:35.450 --> 0:43:49.170 Vinha, Fernando I think will not make change in this is this is there and everyone has access so could release the screening. You can use this, this and this screen. You cannot use others later. Have to define it. OK who do what? OK. 0:43:50.450 --> 0:43:51.90 Glyn-Jones, Hugh Thank you. 0:43:55.670 --> 0:43:56.230 Vinha, Fernando Again. 0:43:49.960 --> 0:44:9.720 Kolachalam, Madhu And and and and again Fernando Henry, I think that there are multiple models you can enable access but that that is just technical we can we can do it in multiple ways. I'm just trying to stay at the functional aspect of what what we need and then the the more details we can work with you to finalise on the technical is it though you had your hand up. 0:44:13.240 --> 0:44:16.480 Osusuluwa, Ejiro What out of my mind, I wanted to just speak to what you just said. 0:44:17.920 --> 0:44:46.0 Osusuluwa, Ejiro There are different models in. In each of this system in Oracle that the production model and all of that, the finance model and all of that. But like I said, we might get into that later on, but I don't want us to just focus solely on the production beat because we were we're looking at in terms of when time we go into January, which is the time we're looking at, we're not just focusing on having access to just the production beat. 0:44:47.350 --> 0:45:6.430 Osusuluwa, Ejiro From for last point of view, in terms of forecasting, in terms of being, we need access to every single information material, pricing, usage and all of that. So those kind of information, it will not just be restricted only to just the production beat or to the beat around. 0:45:8.110 --> 0:45:18.510 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Work order. So we're looking at planning. We're looking at material purchase and all of that inventory and stuff like that. So it's it's going to be. 0:45:18.980 --> 0:45:42.500 Osusuluwa, Ejiro How do we for me? How? Because, like I said, the the bits of detail will probably need to work out, but we need to look at top level to understand that why we have this functionality. How do we integrate that into our own exist system? How all those information will flow, read time on time to the team in 20s as well? 0:45:43.640 --> 0:46:21.200 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it, got it. Now I have it. I'm miss. I understand the the big picture and the model. I have another question more specific to manufacturing. I think what we discussed is transactional nature, cost, visibility information and all. But if we look at the core manufacturing on the shop floor, the production efficiency, the operational equipment efficiency, what's happening on the shelf floor, that is not coming through Oracle, that will never come through, you'll get a financial information from Oracle but and you'll get some what we are completing, what material is getting issued back, flushed all that from Oracle. But if you want to really understand the manufacturing execution on the floor. 0:46:22.30 --> 0:46:48.590 Kolachalam, Madhu That's where, for example, in Andover, they use line view in. In Poland they use smart RDM. Different solutions which take whether it's a human being, configuring an activity or or is it the manufacturing equipment which is doing certain activity and then show what is actually happening on the production line in a real time is that a system we are looking at or is that is that even something elixir is considering? 0:46:54.70 --> 0:46:55.70 Glyn-Jones, Hugh You're on mute. 0:46:53.900 --> 0:46:55.340 Kolachalam, Madhu Sorry, Fernando, you're on mute. 0:46:54.860 --> 0:46:56.140 Osusuluwa, Ejiro When I'm near muted. 0:47:19.650 --> 0:47:20.10 Kolachalam, Madhu Yes. 0:47:20.120 --> 0:47:51.280 Vinha, Fernando Location working process location. You can see you have the the the full visibility of all material is the way you set up it in the system. Just it because when you set up some raw material you have to set up who is the supplier approved suppliers, the lead time, the minimum stock. So you can get a level that when you reach the minimum event or the the system are plagued to your you have to buy or you don't have to buy all these things you can do OK you have to do this material plan. 0:47:51.880 --> 0:47:53.80 Vinha, Fernando Nrp. OK. 0:48:2.570 --> 0:48:3.10 Thiagarajah, Thisan Voice. 0:47:52.10 --> 0:48:22.170 Barrington, Kyle They, they they, Maddie. And so my view is stuff like line view or the Poland system, which I forget its name. I think I I see that as a nice nice to have. I think there's other I think monitoring O EE for example at a higher level initially is is OK IE what's our maximum output we could have had. Oh actually we produced X so therefore our O EE was. 0:48:22.880 --> 0:48:23.880 Barrington, Kyle X percent or whatever.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team discusses the integration of different models into their existing system, specifically in relation to Oracle. They emphasize the need for access to all information, not just the production aspect, including material, pricing, and usage. They also discuss the importance of real-time information flow to the team. The conversation then shifts to the specifics of manufacturing, with a focus on production efficiency and operational equipment efficiency. They discuss the use of different solutions to monitor activities on the production line in real time. The discussion concludes with the mention of monitoring operational efficiency at a higher level.
