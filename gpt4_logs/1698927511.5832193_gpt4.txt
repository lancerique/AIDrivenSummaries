Write a concise summary of the following:


since the channels where you are selling it based on the channel based on the promotional activities that all what you are monitoring it here. 1:29:11.270 --> 1:29:45.110 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yes, yes, we are with we are interested in all of that and we're monitoring that because that is a very key element also into the SNOPSNOP meeting you know, because it was selling and stocks are not being depleted and all of that, then there won't be any any demand. The production guys won't get the orders to be able to produce. So it's a very key element of of information from FMC. We currently get that data offline. So if in spite of what we've discussed discerning around how we can be able to integrate those information. 1:29:45.920 --> 1:29:46.40 Nudrat A Hmm. 1:29:45.870 --> 1:29:46.630 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Into. 1:29:46.950 --> 1:30:14.710 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Existing system or in Oracle because Elixir and FMC are used the same application. So in elixir you can if you have the access right, you can actually pull those datas and get visibility of that as to what is the order and sale that FMC has done. You could get the closing inventory of. 1:30:16.470 --> 1:30:18.910 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Stock in all the FMC warehouses across. 1:30:19.640 --> 1:30:36.840 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Nigeria, by region by distributors those information are available in Oracle and you can actually do the integration, but we can't. So if there are opportunities to get that information out into our own system will be nice to have because it's something that we also require. 1:30:37.980 --> 1:30:40.620 Nudrat A K Another question is so is this. 1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:55.320 Nudrat A Hmm. 1:30:40.160 --> 1:31:4.880 Ohikhuai, Henry To add to what's a general, just to add to what's a general mentioned is a key thing you see on this. Your bosses you have shown Alesia and Fmcl can have access to this data. If you have the access. But Twinings doesn't have direct system access to this data. We only rely on fmcl when we need to get this information. So. 1:31:6.240 --> 1:31:10.840 Ohikhuai, Henry At times you have difficulty to be able to reconcile this information. 1:31:11.280 --> 1:31:18.920 Ohikhuai, Henry When you want to do your own analysis this by this how the performance of your your products is in the market. 1:31:19.940 --> 1:31:22.20 Nudrat A OK, I I got it. I got it. 1:31:20.850 --> 1:31:27.490 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Just one point to add just one point to add to what Amy said. So even in the demand planning. 1:31:29.50 --> 1:31:37.650 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Based on the agreement we have with eligia, I mean FMCL for finished goods, stock level needs to be 70 days. 1:31:39.250 --> 1:31:46.610 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And if it's going above stocks 70 days, Fmcl would not accept or allow. 1:31:48.210 --> 1:31:48.530 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Any other? 1:31:50.850 --> 1:31:53.890 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Product to be invoiced then you know so. 1:32:0.950 --> 1:32:1.70 Nudrat A Hmm. 1:31:54.920 --> 1:32:22.160 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Keeping track of what is the in market sales from FMCL to the different channels and having visibility of that closing stock is very key. But like Erin said, we cannot look big shareholder. We don't have direct access or visibility into that system is but they can pull that data and share with us. And based on that it's what we use in the input for S and OP process. 1:32:26.80 --> 1:32:27.560 Nudrat A Oh, I'll. I'll be having. 1:32:27.10 --> 1:32:37.650 Kolachalam, Madhu That sorry, I have one question, but is ROHINDE would would what Fmcl is selling and the distribution and the channels, would that not be? 1:32:38.730 --> 1:32:40.90 Kolachalam, Madhu What whining sees? 1:32:41.470 --> 1:32:47.750 Kolachalam, Madhu Selling to Fmcl because trainings has the data right in Sapb 1, right? 1:32:53.600 --> 1:32:54.40 Kolachalam, Madhu Yes. 1:32:45.890 --> 1:33:15.530 Ohikhuai, Henry No, no, Twinings twinies have the data on. They say be one. They already sued to Fmcl. That is the end of their visibility of that data. Remember in Fncs talk they are supposed to keep a 70 days talk there why they are feeding up to the the distributor and the channels. So you you always have a 70 days talk buffer behind at this FMCS point. Why? 1:33:15.340 --> 1:33:16.20 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it. 1:33:16.10 --> 1:33:17.930 Ohikhuai, Henry They are always feeding the distribution channel so. 1:33:18.620 --> 1:33:29.460 Ohikhuai, Henry And what you can see most often for me, what I see on daily basis sometimes on exer is what is an fmcl stock. I don't have this ability of what is outside there. 1:33:30.390 --> 1:33:31.470 Kolachalam, Madhu Got it, got it. 1:33:30.170 --> 1:33:59.690 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And so just to add a game, the inventory, we can double check on that, but top of my mind the inventory that should be kept at the other channel, other distributors is 45 days, so why 70 days is for what is kept in the FMC warehouse across Nigeria for the distributors, the other channels, the wholesalers


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the monitoring of sales and stock levels across different channels. The team is interested in integrating data from FMC into their existing system or Oracle, as it is a key element in their SNOPSNOP meetings. Currently, they get this data offline. They also discuss the challenges of not having direct system access to this data, which makes it difficult to reconcile information for their own analysis. The agreement with FMCL requires a 70-day stock level for finished goods, and exceeding this limit is not allowed. The team emphasizes the importance of tracking in-market sales and having visibility of closing stock. However, they lack direct access or visibility into the system, relying on data shared by FMCL for their SNOP process.
