Write a concise summary of the following:


buying and all, but it has a contract information to say this is the, this is the price. This is the effective date and that is where finance approves it. Any time the dates change or the volumes change or the price changes, it again goes back to approval and the and the materials team just executes against the agreement. And that control is there in almost every system. So materials team cannot create any PO. 2:8:56.575 --> 2:8:58.55 Kolachalam, Madhu Outside, not connected to an agreement. 2:8:58.925 --> 2:8:59.165 Barrington, Kyle Yeah. 2:8:58.735 --> 2:8:59.615 Kolachalam, Madhu So that was. 2:9:3.125 --> 2:9:4.645 Barrington, Kyle That sounds great, yeah. 2:9:10.795 --> 2:9:11.35 Thiagarajah, Thisan Hey. 2:9:14.645 --> 2:9:15.365 Barrington, Kyle Yeah, yeah. 2:9:0.905 --> 2:9:31.465 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yeah, I agree. But I think that's that's what I was speaking to. So currently I have to send to your point, we have this ability of that we do that reconciliation, but it's almost like after the fact has happened. So the turn of exercise is one of them that we do, we have a monthly finance call with the ALLEGIA team finance team where we give, we keep track and see you know those price changes. But like where we would want to be is. 2:9:31.815 --> 2:9:34.135 Osusuluwa, Ejiro What appointments raised to say? 2:9:36.255 --> 2:9:47.255 Osusuluwa, Ejiro When those changes are happen, it comes to finance for approval and like the control cheques or control in place and that also would also help in terms of forecasting. 2:9:49.415 --> 2:10:2.735 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Costs analysis and all of that. It will when we're doing forecasting and submission, but currently we don't have, like you said, we don't have visibility of that upfits more around 20 procurement team. 2:10:3.645 --> 2:10:4.845 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And that leaves you. 2:10:6.85 --> 2:10:26.925 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah. And and is it in an ideal world, ideally the agreements should be set up only by Twinings in Oracle, and that can be approved by Alexa finance or multiple stakeholders. And once that is approved, then everything else as long as you're following, then it's a materials function against that agreement. What volumes you order is a demand planning material planning function. 2:10:26.235 --> 2:10:28.515 Osusuluwa, Ejiro Yeah, yeah, I agree. 2:10:29.775 --> 2:10:30.135 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 2:10:30.85 --> 2:10:35.325 Thiagarajah, Thisan Is that a function of Oracle? Then madhuya? Is that what you're saying? There's something in Morocco that does that, or so something else. 2:10:37.295 --> 2:10:37.335 Thiagarajah, Thisan I. 2:10:34.695 --> 2:10:40.455 Kolachalam, Madhu Yeah, work lsap all. All of them have the basic control on that right now. We might not have enabled that. 2:10:39.385 --> 2:10:52.425 Ohikhuai, Henry Yes, Oracle has that spot. The issue is that the communication for for Oracle, for the warehouse manager in Alicia to take that action comes their e-mail. 2:10:55.695 --> 2:10:56.975 Ohikhuai, Henry The vendor, yeah. 2:11:5.415 --> 2:11:6.95 Ohikhuai, Henry Alright. 2:11:6.245 --> 2:11:7.445 Kolachalam, Madhu As a separate PO. 2:11:8.765 --> 2:11:9.445 Ohikhuai, Henry Alright. 2:11:8.565 --> 2:11:20.205 Kolachalam, Madhu So basically, price price has a field, is never editable by anybody in Alexa or materials team. They can only use what is there in the current agreement. I think that is the standard which systems can provide. 2:11:20.235 --> 2:11:20.715 Thiagarajah, Thisan Nice. 2:11:22.565 --> 2:11:22.725 Vinha, Fernando Ag. 2:11:23.25 --> 2:11:45.145 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. And and what about the computer pay in terms of fulfilment or delivery, right? How do we communicate to suppliers? Are there bottlenecks or are that is being we send, is it primarily through mails, do we print POS or to supply US access elixir through a a portal or Internet portal because Oracle has AI supplier portal and everything, right? 2:11:46.185 --> 2:11:52.145 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So pills are generated from Oracle and sent by e-mail to the suppliers. 2:11:55.45 --> 2:11:55.325 Vinha, Fernando It. 2:11:55.635 --> 2:12:8.835 Osusuluwa, Ejiro And in terms of payment, the payment terms that are already imputed in the system, so when you're on your payment run, you see what the invoices are due based on those payments and what you need to make payment for is on the payment from. 2:12:9.765 --> 2:12:10.5 Vinha, Fernando Yeah. 2:12:10.865 --> 2:12:11.385 Kolachalam, Madhu OK. 2:12:11.565 --> 2:12:19.285 Vinha, Fernando A01 question how how do you manage to take goods? Returns would destroy how who manage it? 2:12:20.345 --> 2:12:29.425 Vinha, Fernando If you have some goods returned from the market to you, how who manage and how you manage it in this kind of things, because we have to to see how we gonna do that in the future. 2:12:30.75 --> 2:12:47.355 Osusuluwa, Ejiro So interestingly interesting in so far in my experience working with the business, we've not had


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The discussion revolves around the process of procurement and finance in an organization. The team discusses the importance of having a contract with clear information about the price and effective date, which needs to be approved by finance. Any changes in dates, volumes, or prices require re-approval. The materials team executes against the agreement and cannot create any purchase orders (POs) not connected to an agreement. The team also discusses the need for better visibility and control checks for changes in price and volume, which would aid in forecasting and cost analysis. The ideal scenario would be for agreements to be set up in Oracle, approved by finance, and then executed by the materials team. The team also discusses the functionality of Oracle and other systems like SAP in controlling these processes. The conversation also touches on the process of generating and sending POs to suppliers and managing payments. The team also briefly discusses the management of returned goods.
