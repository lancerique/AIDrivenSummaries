containers we'd need, could we tell logistics that you know we might have an increase in the number of boxes going from China to Europe and so it's can we take this data and let it interact what the output is very simple in terms of the the system and what the people have to do. 0:38:47.100 --> 0:38:48.620 Dempsey Tim So that's all. 0:38:48.720 --> 0:38:55.820 Dempsey Tim That's all kind of wish list, and obviously configuring the system you at lead times you know the data side of it. 0:38:55.960 --> 0:38:58.990 Dempsey Tim We can do a lot of that and we've already done a lot of that. 0:38:59.200 --> 0:39:0.470 Dempsey Tim OK, it's the. 0:39:1.510 --> 0:39:7.310 Dempsey Tim It's the kind of technology enabling side that we need some help with, yeah. 0:39:6.820 --> 0:39:9.790 Ricciardi Luca And and if I, yeah, I I completely sponsor. 0:39:9.800 --> 0:39:10.450 Ricciardi Luca What team said? 0:39:10.460 --> 0:39:20.110 Ricciardi Luca I mean, I'm fully in agreement what I want to underline as well is that from my point of view, SAP will continue to be the source of information even in terms of master data. 0:39:20.120 --> 0:39:34.540 Ricciardi Luca So the more we can be integrated with the SAP and let's say the last kind of differences between the two system, we will generate that the better for sure because it's a it's an important part from my point of view. 0:39:34.550 --> 0:39:43.880 Ricciardi Luca If you need to map map out something in a different master data that then we are gonna be creating some deltas that will create some confusion and noise. 0:39:44.30 --> 0:39:48.680 Ricciardi Luca So I think also considering the master data from SAP would be extremely important. 0:39:49.310 --> 0:39:50.940 Dempsey Tim We've no, I agree. Luca. 0:39:50.950 --> 0:39:54.820 Dempsey Tim We've, I mean, we've made a significant investment in rolling out SAP partner globally. 0:39:55.10 --> 0:39:57.180 Dempsey Tim OK, that's our chosen ERP. 0:39:57.410 --> 0:39:59.40 Dempsey Tim What we're looking for is. 0:40:5.290 --> 0:40:5.400 Pankaj Gadekar Yes. 0:40:18.450 --> 0:40:19.200 Pankaj Gadekar You know, yeah. 0:40:19.260 --> 0:40:27.820 Dempsey Tim Quickly and it's it's the interaction of all these flows that comes with a kind of a scenario that says this is how the proposal would look. 0:40:28.310 --> 0:40:30.360 Dempsey Tim What you guys want to do so yeah. 0:40:30.370 --> 0:40:30.820 Pankaj Gadekar Got it. 0:40:30.840 --> 0:40:31.230 Dempsey Tim Ohh. 0:40:31.440 --> 0:40:46.930 Pankaj Gadekar Now, out of all these different operations per say, and you know your business well, the you know if if one has to start doing this at a priority, what would be your priority of looking into issues? 0:40:52.450 --> 0:40:52.720 Dempsey Tim Umm. 0:40:47.830 --> 0:40:53.260 Pankaj Gadekar I'm just asking this just to have some hint in terms of sort of devoicing. 0:40:53.270 --> 0:40:56.390 Pankaj Gadekar My approach at a high level that how should I propose to you? 0:40:57.290 --> 0:41:2.540 Pankaj Gadekar It's better to start with your most you know serious concerns or a challenge. 0:41:3.350 --> 0:41:3.560 Dempsey Tim Mm-hmm. 0:41:3.530 --> 0:41:3.860 Pankaj Gadekar Uh. 0:41:4.290 --> 0:41:14.660 Pankaj Gadekar And you know, when we look at this data, few things also needs to be considered from a technical point of view because the base data is first, of course needs to be there in the system. 0:41:15.90 --> 0:41:15.490 Dempsey Tim Umm. 0:41:15.270 --> 0:41:20.930 Pankaj Gadekar But it can be worked out in an approach which can start addressing some of your immediate concerns. 0:41:22.880 --> 0:41:23.70 Dempsey Tim Yeah. 0:41:20.940 --> 0:41:31.20 Pankaj Gadekar So if I may ask you if if one gives an option of doing this in a in an incremental manner, what would be three key things in a priority for you? 0:41:31.940 --> 0:41:44.630 Dempsey Tim I mean, I would, I would say the first thing that we have to do is fix a stable supply of product to to all the supplying plans in a very low, stressful way. 0:41:44.640 --> 0:41:46.190 Dempsey Tim So so take the stress away. 0:41:46.320 --> 0:41:48.600 Dempsey Tim So get the right priorities in the system. 0:41:48.610 --> 0:41:58.400 Dempsey Tim That means from from a supply planning network side, we are we are getting the right stock in the right place at the right time that over time we can optimize. 0:41:58.470 --> 0:42:2.800 Dempsey Tim But that would be the basic, you know, do the basics well and then build on the basics. 0:42:5.760 --> 0:42:5.980 Pankaj Gadekar Yep. 0:42:6.720 --> 0:42:6.880 Ricciardi Luca Yep. 0:42:9.660 --> 0:42:9.860 Ricciardi Luca Now. 0:42:13.610 --> 0:42:13.930 Ricciardi Luca Correct. 0:42:9.120 --> 0:42:25.430 Dempsey Tim As part of that, as Lucas kind of said, the kind of the horizontal planning element of this, you know, because it's, you know, you know, if we have a surge, a surge in demand anticipated in quarter two next year, it might be that in quarter


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The team discussed the potential increase in the number of boxes being shipped from China to Europe and the need for data to predict this. They have already configured a system to handle some of this data, but need help with the technology side. They agreed that SAP will continue to be their source of information and that integration with SAP is crucial. They also discussed the importance of having the right stock in the right place at the right time and the need for a stable supply of product. The team is considering an incremental approach to address these issues, with the first priority being to ensure a stress-free supply of products.
